# Unauthorized Agent Control After NFT Transfer

## *Summary*
A vulnerability in the BlueprintCore smart contract allows the original owner of an NFT to retain control over an agent even after transferring the NFT to a new owner. This occurs because the contract does not update or invalidate the agent’s status when an NFT is transferred. Consequently, the original owner can continue to manage the agent (e.g., updating configurations, submitting proof, and controlling deployment status), while the new owner is prevented from creating a new agent using the same NFT. This issue poses risks of system abuse, financial loss, and operational disruption.

### Code Snippet:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L427-L477

### *Vulnerability Details*

1. **One-Time Ownership Check**:
   - The contract verifies NFT ownership only when an agent is created via `createAgent`.
   - It does not check for continued ownership when the agent is modified or accessed.

2. **No Invalidation on NFT Transfer**:
   - The contract does not track NFT transfer events or update its internal state upon transfer.
   - As a result, `deploymentOwners` and `nftTokenIdMap` remain linked to the original owner.

#### *Steps to Reproduce*
1. **Alice Creates an Agent**:
   - Alice owns an NFT with `tokenId = 123`.
   - She calls `createAgent`, and the contract:
     - Confirms her NFT ownership.
     - Assigns `tokenId = 123` to her address in `nftTokenIdMap` and `deploymentOwners`.
     - Creates the agent with a `Status.Pickup` state.

2. **Alice Transfers the NFT to Bob**:
   - Alice transfers `tokenId = 123` to Bob, making him the new rightful owner.
   - However, the contract’s state remains unchanged:
     - `nftTokenIdMap[123]` still references Alice.
     - `deploymentOwners[requestID]` still lists Alice.

3. **Bob Attempts to Create an Agent**:
   - Bob calls `createAgent` with `tokenId = 123`.
   - The contract checks `nftTokenIdMap[123]` and finds that it is already set to `Status.Pickup` (used by Alice).
   - The transaction fails with the error: *"NFT token ID already used"*.

4. **Alice Retains Control**:
   - Despite no longer owning the NFT, Alice can still:
     - Modify deployment configurations via `updateWorkerDeploymentConfigCommon`.
     - Submit proof for deployments using `submitProofOfDeployment`.
     - Change deployment status and trigger events.

---

### *Impact*

#### *1. Unauthorized Control Over Agents*
- The previous owner (Alice) maintains agent privileges even after transferring the NFT.
- This includes:
  - Adjusting deployment configurations.
  - Submitting deployment proofs.
  - Modifying deployment status.

#### *2. New Owner is Restricted*
- The new owner (Bob) cannot create a new agent with the NFT since `tokenId` remains linked to the previous owner.
- Even though `tokenId` checks prevent multiple registrations, the prior owner can still exert control.

---

### *Recommendations*

#### *1. Invalidate Agents on NFT Transfer*
- Integrate the contract with the NFT contract to detect `Transfer` events.
- Upon transfer, invalidate the agent by:
  - Resetting `nftTokenIdMap[tokenId]` to `Status.Init`.
  - Removing the previous owner from `deploymentOwners`.

**Example Implementation:**
```solidity
function onNFTTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) external {
    require(msg.sender == nftContractAddress, "Only NFT contract can call this");

    // Invalidate the agent if the NFT is transferred
    if (nftTokenIdMap[tokenId] == Status.Pickup) {
        nftTokenIdMap[tokenId] = Status.Init; // Reset status
    }
}
```

#### *2. Continuously Verify NFT Ownership*
- Require ownership verification whenever an agent is accessed or modified.
- Before allowing calls to `updateWorkerDeploymentConfigCommon` or `submitProofOfDeployment`, check if the caller still owns the NFT.

**Example Implementation:**
```solidity
function updateWorkerDeploymentConfigCommon(
    address tokenAddress,
    address userAddress,
    bytes32 projectId,
    bytes32 requestID,
    string memory updatedBase64Config
) internal hasProject(projectId) {
    require(requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status != Status.Init, "requestID does not exist");
    require(bytes(updatedBase64Config).length > 0, "updatedBase64Config is empty");
    require(requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status != Status.Issued, "requestID is not picked up by any worker");

    // Verify ownership before allowing updates
    if (deploymentOwners[requestID] == userAddress && nftTokenIdMap[tokenId] == Status.Pickup) {
        require(checkNFTOwnership(nftContractAddress, tokenId, userAddress), "NFT token not owned by user");
    }
}
```

By implementing these changes, the contract can ensure that only the rightful owner of an NFT retains control over its associated agent, preventing unauthorized actions and system abuse.
