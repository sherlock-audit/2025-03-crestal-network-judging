# Blueprint.sol:41,21  The owner can cause DoS, affecting the protocol

### Summary

Calling `Blueprint::setWhitelistAddresses` or `Blueprint::removeWhitelistAddresses` with a large array cause the owner to be unable to pay for the transaction gas

### Root Cause

The functions `Blueprint::setWhitelistAddresses` and `Blueprint::removeWhitelistAddresses` use an unbounded `for` loop to process input arrays. This can lead to a **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack scenario if the input arrays are large, as the gas costs for these functions increase significantly with the size of the arrays.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The owner should call `Blueprint::setWhitelistAddresses` or `Blueprint::removeWhitelistAddresses` with an input array of a great size

### External Pre-conditions

No external Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

The owner calls `Blueprint::setWhitelistAddresses` or `Blueprint::removeWhitelistAddresses` functions

### Impact

If the input arrays are large, the gas costs for these functions will rise dramatically, which could make it impossible for users to afford the transaction. This could lead to the function calls failing due to exceeding the gas limit, resulting in an overall poor user experience and potential service denial.

### PoC

function testDosAttack() public {
        address[] memory testAddress = new address[](20);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 20; i++)
        {
            testAddress[i] = (address(uint160(i+1)));
        }
        uint256 gasUsed = gasleft();
        blueprint.setWhitelistAddresses(testAddress);
        console.log("Spent for 20 addresses: ", gasUsed - gasleft());
        address[] memory testAddress2 = new address[](1000);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
        {
            testAddress2[i] = address(uint160(101 + i));
        }
        gasUsed = gasleft();
        blueprint.setWhitelistAddresses(testAddress2);
        console.log("Spent for 1000 addresses: ", gasUsed - gasleft());

    }

Logs:
  Spent for 20 addresses:  460389
  Spent for 1000 addresses:  22629451

### Mitigation

Instead of using an unbounded loop, limit the number of addresses that can be added or removed in one transaction. For example, allow a maximum of 10 addresses to be added or removed at a time. This will ensure that the gas costs remain manageable.
