# public visibility of important mappings which will severely effect the working of protocol

### Summary

in contract `BlueprintCore.sol` the following mapping have their visibility set to public 

1.`whitelistUsers` in line 80 [link ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/27a3c28155702b3a68f29347efedffb048010e33/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L80C39-L80C53)
2. `paymentAddressesMp` in line 93 [link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/27a3c28155702b3a68f29347efedffb048010e33/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L93C41-L93C59)
3. `paymentAddressEnableMp` in line 95 [link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/27a3c28155702b3a68f29347efedffb048010e33/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L95C37-L95C59)
4. `paymentOpCostMp` in line 97 [link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/27a3c28155702b3a68f29347efedffb048010e33/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L97C59-L97C74)
5. `userTopUpMp` in line 99 [link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/27a3c28155702b3a68f29347efedffb048010e33/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L99C60-L99C71)

### Root Cause

 all the above mentioned mapping have public visibility modifier allowing anyone to change them which will severely effect the working of protocol

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

the attacker just need inherit the `BlueprintCore.sol` contract and call the above mentioned mapping 
then the attacker can change the value of those mapping and can  severely effect the working of protocol

### Impact

1. in `whitelistUsers` mapping attacker can set the status of whitelist address or delete the address from `whitelistUsers`
2. in `paymentAddressesMp` mapping  attacker can add and remove the ERC20 token address which is being used for paying the fees
3. in `paymentAddressEnableMp` mapping attacker can change the status of ERC20 token can lead to causing the require statement to revert or allowing payment on the ERC20 token that they added
4. in mappings `paymentOpCostMp` and `userTopUpMp` they can change the created agent operation cost and the user top-up amount.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

make the above mentioned mapping private and create function for each mapping that set or update the value for those mapping in contract `BlueprintCore.sol` and mark those function with access control like onlyowner etc
