# Workers can front-run each other in deployment request submission

### Summary

The first-come-first-served mechanism in submitDeploymentRequest allows miners or workers to front-run legitimate workers, potentially taking over deployments intended for specific workers.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L602

### Root Cause

 In BlueprintCore.sol, the submitDeploymentRequest function assigns deployments on a first-come-first-served basis without additional protection:


```solidity
function submitDeploymentRequest(bytes32 projectId, bytes32 requestID)
    public
    hasProject(projectId)
    returns (bool isAccepted)
{
    // [...validation checks...]

    // currently, do first come, first server, will do a better way in the future
    requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status = Status.Pickup;
    requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].deployWorkerAddr = msg.sender;

    isAccepted = true;

    emit AcceptDeployment(projectId, requestID, requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].deployWorkerAddr);
}

```

### Internal Pre-conditions

.

### External Pre-conditions

.

### Attack Path

A legitimate worker sees a deployment request and prepares to submit a transaction
An attacker (possibly a miner) sees this pending transaction
The attacker submits their own transaction with higher gas price
The attacker's transaction gets mined first, assigning the deployment to them



### Impact

This can lead to unfair distribution of work, reduced trust in the platform, and potentially lower quality deployments if specialized tasks are assigned to unqualified workers.

### PoC

.

### Mitigation

Implement a commit-reveal scheme for worker assignment
Add reputation-based priority for worker selection
Consider batch processing of worker assignments in time windows
