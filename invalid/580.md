# Unauthorized Token Transfers via Unprotected `payWithERC20` Function

### Summary

The `payWithERC20` function in the `Payment` contract lacks access control, allowing any user to call it and initiate arbitrary token transfers from addresses that have granted allowance to the contract. This enables an attacker to drain ERC-20 tokens from users who have approved the contract, without requiring a valid signature or permission check. The issue stems from the function being declared public, meaning it can be called externally without any restrictions.

### Root Cause

The contract assumes that `payWithERC20` will only be called from internal trusted flows (e.g., when a user is legitimately making a payment via `createAgentWithToken`). However, because the function is public and does not enforce any caller validation, it can be invoked by anyone, enabling unauthorized token transfers from approved addresses.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The contract has been deployed and contains the payWithERC20 function.
-  A user has granted token approval to the contract to spend their ERC-20 tokens (e.g., via approve(`contractAddress`, `amount`)).
- The contract has a mapping that associates token payment operations with costs, allowing tokens to be transferred for various functions.

### External Pre-conditions

- The attacker identifies a victim who has approved the contract to spend tokens on their behalf.
- The attacker can send a transaction calling `payWithERC20`, specifying the victim’s address as the from parameter and their own address as the to parameter.
- There are no access controls, signatures, or authentication mechanisms preventing the call.

### Attack Path

1. **Victim grants approval**: A user interacts with the contract and calls approve(contractAddress, amount), intending to use ERC-20 payments in a legitimate manner.
2. **Attacker calls payWithERC20**: The attacker sends a transaction to payWithERC20, specifying:
- `from` = victim’s address
- `to` = attacker’s wallet
- `amount` = any amount within the approved allowance
3. **Tokens are transferred**: The contract executes `safeTransferFrom(from, to, amount)`, moving funds from the victim to the attacker.
4. **Repeated execution**: The attacker can repeat this process until the victim’s approved balance is depleted or their allowance is revoked.

### Impact

- **Token Draining**: Any attacker can repeatedly call `payWithERC20` and transfer funds from any user who has previously given approval to the contract.
- **Unauthorized Payments**: Attackers could force users to pay for operations they never intended to, by transferring their tokens to arbitrary addresses.
- **Loss of Funds**: Users who mistakenly approve large allowances may find their entire balance drained without any recourse.
- **Trust Issues**: Users may hesitate to approve token allowances if they become aware of this vulnerability, reducing adoption.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. **Restrict Access**: Change the function from `public` to `internal`, ensuring it is only called from within the contract.
2. **Require Permission Checks**: Implement a modifier (e.g., `onlyOwner` or `onlyTrustedCaller`) that restricts external calls.
3. **Use Signatures for Authorization**: Require the sender to provide an EIP-712 signed message approving each token transfer.
4. **Emit Events for Transparency**: Log each transfer so users can monitor unexpected deductions from their accounts.
