# Payment::payWithERC20 lacks access control

### Summary

The `Payment::payWithERC20` function handles payments when creating agents for users. It is intended to transfer tokens approved by users from their addresses to the protocol's `feeRecipient`. However, since the function is `public` and lacks any restrictions, attackers can call it to redirect all approved tokens from users to their own addresses.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/Payment.sol#L25-L32

The function does not have sufficient checks to prevent unauthorized transfers.

### Internal Pre-conditions

* Users have approved the contract to handle some amount of their tokens.

### External Pre-conditions

*No Response*

### Attack Path

A typical scenario:

1. A user intends to call `createAgentWithToken`, so they `approve` the contract to spend their tokens.
2. Since this interaction happens in **two steps** (approval followed by createAgentWithToken), an attacker can monitor approval transactions related to the Blueprint contract for accepted payment tokens (or even other tokens).
3. The attacker then calls `payWithERC20`, using their own address as the recipient.

### Impact

* Loss of user funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement access control or make the function internal.
