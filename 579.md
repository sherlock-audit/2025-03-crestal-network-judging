# Missing Access Control allows malicious resetting of project

### Summary

The protocol does not implement any Access Control on the sensitive `upgradeProject()` function

### Root Cause

[upgradeProject()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L198-L203) resets critical project data, including proposal and deployment requests. 
Without access control, any malicius user can erase project data, leading to DOSs or interference with legitimate operations. Restricting it to the project owner prevents unauthorized resets and ensures only authorized modifications.

```solidity
    function upgradeProject(bytes32 projectId) public hasProject(projectId) {
        
        // reset project info
        projects[projectId].requestProposalID = 0;
        projects[projectId].requestDeploymentID = 0;
        projects[projectId].proposedSolverAddr = dummyAddress;
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Valid projectId

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

	1.	createProjectIDAndDeploymentRequest() → for public deployments.
	2.	The project is now active, waiting for execution.
	3.	Malicious user calls upgradeProject(projectId), which resets:
	        • requestProposalID = 0
	        • requestDeploymentID = 0
	        • proposedSolverAddr = dummyAddress
	4.	This erases the pending deployment and forces the user to restart the process.
	5.	The legitimate user tries to proceed, but the deployment request no longer exists.
	6.	If the malicious user repeatedly calls upgradeProject(), the user is unable to complete deployment.
	7.	This results in continuous disruption, effectively blocking progress and making the project unusable.

### Impact

Temporary DOS

Attackers can repeatedly call upgradeProject(), preventing a valid proposal from ever reaching the deployment stage.

### Mitigation

Add Access control to `upgradeProject()`
