# Attacker can reset information about a project due to lack of access control in `upgradeProject`

## Vulnerability Details

As there's no access control in `upgradeProject`, an attacker can call this function to reset the `requestProposalID`, `requestDeploymentID` and `proposedSolverAddr` for any existing project.

For example, one griefing attack scenario could be:

- User calls `createProjectIDAndProposalRequest` or `createProjectIDAndProposalRequestWithSig`, setting a `requestProposalID` for that `projectId`
- Attacker calls `upgrateProject` for that `projectId`, resetting the project information
- User calls `getProjectInfo` for that `projectId`, which will return 0 instead of the expected value for the `requestProposalID`
- User would have to call `createProjectIDAndProposalRequest` if he wants to create a project again, but then attacker could just reset the data again, continuing the cycle and griefing the protocol operations.

## Impact

Information such as `requestProposalID`, `requestDeploymentID` and `proposedSolverAddr` can be erased at any time. Since deployment is made on base with low gas fees, griefer could monitor the contract events and always call `upgradeProject` when projects get created, effectively erasing data for all projects.

## Tools Used

Manual Review.

## Recommendations

Add access control for `upgradeProject` and store the owner of a project so only the owner can upgrade the project/update the project fields.
