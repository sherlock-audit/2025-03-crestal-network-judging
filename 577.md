# Anyone can reset project info causing loss of funds for user creating an agent

### Summary

Lack of access control in the `BlueprintCore::upgradeProject(...)` function allows anyone to reset project info for any project. Let's consider a user that calls `createAgentWithToken(...)`.
This is the chain of subcalls that we will get:
`createAgentWithToken(...)` -> `createAgent(...)` -> `createCommonProjectIDAndDeploymentRequest(...)` -> `deploymentRequest(...)`
                                                                                     -> `payWithERC20(...)`
we will get:
- `projects[projectId].requestDeploymentID = projectDeploymentId`
- `projects[projectId].proposedSolverAddr = solverAddress`

These will be reset to 0 by a simple call to `BlueprintCore::upgradeProject(...)`

### Root Cause

Lack of access control in the `BlueprintCore::upgradeProject(...)` function allows anyone to reset project info

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Innocent user has called a function to create an agent like `createAgentWithToken(...)`

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `BlueprintCore::upgradeProject(...)` to reset project info to 0 

### Impact

The whole protocol is impacted as users can pay to create agent and the project info can be set back to info by any malicious user incurring in loss of funds for the user who ended up paying for nothing in the end.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add access control to this function or remove it completely.
