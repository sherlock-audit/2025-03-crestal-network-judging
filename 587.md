# there is no access control in upgrade function, which would reset the data

### Summary

In blueprintcore.sol, there is 

```solidity
function upgradeProject(bytes32 projectId) public hasProject(projectId) {
        // reset project info
        projects[projectId].requestProposalID = 0;
        projects[projectId].requestDeploymentID = 0;
        projects[projectId].proposedSolverAddr = dummyAddress;
    }
```
which is public and can be called by anyone, access control should be there

### Root Cause

public function
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L198C2-L203C6

### Internal Pre-conditions

project has been created , request proposal has been created,

### External Pre-conditions

attacker call this function continuously

### Attack Path

attack call this function with tokenID and will reset all data of tokenID

### Impact

All data of tokenID would be reset, when attacker will call this function, which can be before deployment or after too. all data will be reset

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

access control should be there like there it is in updateWorkerDeploymentConfigCommon()
