# Lack of access control in `payWithERC20` results in unauthorized token transfers.

**Summary:** 

The [Payment::payWithERC20](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/Payment.sol#L25) can be used to steal approved funds from users. The protocol team made an update to make it internal `after the contest started` making it a valid issue.

**Description:** 

The `payWithERC20` function is used by the following functions along with their stated reasons,
- createAgent(): Transfers user-approved funds from caller to `feeCollectionWalletAddress` when a user creates agent.
- updateWorkerDeploymentConfigCommon(): Transfers the cost of updated configurations to `feeCollectionWalletAddress`.
- userTopUp(): Transfers cost of crediting user with funds so they could talk to Agent to execute some skill.
The issue is, this function is marked `public`. 

```javascript

@>  function payWithERC20(address erc20TokenAddress, uint256 amount, address fromAddress, address toAddress) public {
        // check from and to address
        require(fromAddress != toAddress, "Cannot transfer to self address");
        require(toAddress != address(0), "Invalid to address");
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        IERC20 token = IERC20(erc20TokenAddress);

        token.safeTransferFrom(fromAddress, toAddress, amount);
    }

```

Even though Base has a private mempool, here is how it could be exploited,
- Attacker monitors the blockchain for Approval events targeting the protocolâ€™s address.
- User wants to call `userTopUp` (just an example) with 25 tokens.
- User gives approval of 25 tokens to Blueprint. 
- The approval is minted, attacker calls `payWithERC20` with user's address as `fromAddress` & provides their own address for `toAddress`.


Attacker can easily steal tokens and use them to `topUp` for free or create agents for free.

This attack would succeed depending on which transaction gets executed first, attacker's call to `payWithERC20` or user's call to the function making it a medium severity issue. 

**Impact:** 

Funds theft due to lack of access control.

**Recommended Mitigation:** 

Mark the function as internal

```diff
-   function payWithERC20(address erc20TokenAddress, uint256 amount, address fromAddress, address toAddress) public {
+   function payWithERC20(address erc20TokenAddress, uint256 amount, address fromAddress, address toAddress) internal {
        // check from and to address
        require(fromAddress != toAddress, "Cannot transfer to self address");
        require(toAddress != address(0), "Invalid to address");
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        IERC20 token = IERC20(erc20TokenAddress);

        token.safeTransferFrom(fromAddress, toAddress, amount);
    }

```
