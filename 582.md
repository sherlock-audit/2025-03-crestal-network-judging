# Missing Approval Check and Not approve the amount in payWithERC20 Function

## Vulnerability Details

There is a critical vulnerability in the `payWithERC20` function of the Payment.sol contract. The function attempts to transfer ERC20 tokens from a user's address to another address without first checking if the contract has sufficient approval to perform this transfer on behalf of the user.

It do not approve the amount for the caller first.

[Payment.sol::payWithERC20](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/Payment.sol#L25)

```solidity
function payWithERC20(address erc20TokenAddress, uint256 amount, address fromAddress, address toAddress) public {
    // check from and to address
    require(fromAddress != toAddress, "Cannot transfer to self address");
    require(toAddress != address(0), "Invalid to address");
    require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
    IERC20 token = IERC20(erc20TokenAddress);
    token.safeTransferFrom(fromAddress, toAddress, amount);
}
```

The function calls `safeTransferFrom` on the ERC20 token contract, which requires the contract to have prior approval from `fromAddress` to transfer the specified `amount` of tokens. However, there is no mechanism in the contract to ensure this approval exists before attempting the transfer.

## Attack Scenario

1. A user interacts with a function in the system that internally calls `payWithERC20`.
2. The user has not previously approved the contract to spend their tokens, or has approved an insufficient amount.
3. The `safeTransferFrom` call will revert due to insufficient allowance.
4. This causes the entire transaction to fail, potentially leaving the system in an inconsistent state or preventing legitimate operations from completing.

## Impact

This vulnerability has several serious impacts:

1. **Transaction Failures**: Users' transactions will fail if they haven't previously approved the contract to spend their tokens, leading to poor user experience.

2. **System Unreliability**: Functions that depend on successful token transfers may not work as expected, causing system-wide reliability issues.

3. **Potential for Stuck Funds or States**: If complex operations are partially completed before the token transfer fails, it could lead to funds or state variables being stuck in an intermediate state.

4. **Increased Gas Costs**: Users will need to execute separate approval transactions before their main transactions can succeed, increasing gas costs and complexity.

## Root Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability is that the `payWithERC20` function assumes that the necessary approval has already been granted by the `fromAddress` to the contract. This is a dangerous assumption, especially in a public function that can be called by anyone.

The comment `// This is to support gasless flow: normally, the caller must always be the msg.sender` suggests that this function is intended to support meta-transactions or similar patterns, but it lacks the necessary checks to ensure that the operation is authorized.

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, implement one of the following approaches:

### Add approval check, Approve amount for the caller first.

### Option 1: Add Explicit Approval Check

```solidity
function payWithERC20(address erc20TokenAddress, uint256 amount, address fromAddress, address toAddress) public {
    // check from and to address
    require(fromAddress != toAddress, "Cannot transfer to self address");
    require(toAddress != address(0), "Invalid to address");
    require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
    
    IERC20 token = IERC20(erc20TokenAddress);
    
    // Check if the contract has sufficient allowance
    uint256 allowance = token.allowance(fromAddress, address(this));
    require(allowance >= amount, "Insufficient allowance");
    
    token.safeTransferFrom(fromAddress, toAddress, amount);
}
```

### Option 2: Implement Proper Authorization for Meta-Transactions

If this function is intended to support meta-transactions, implement proper signature verification:

```solidity
function payWithERC20WithSig(
    address erc20TokenAddress, 
    uint256 amount, 
    address fromAddress, 
    address toAddress,
    uint256 deadline,
    bytes memory signature
) public {
    require(block.timestamp <= deadline, "Transaction expired");
    require(fromAddress != toAddress, "Cannot transfer to self address");
    require(toAddress != address(0), "Invalid to address");
    require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
    
    // Verify the signature
    bytes32 digest = keccak256(
        abi.encodePacked(
            "\x19\x01",
            DOMAIN_SEPARATOR,
            keccak256(abi.encode(
                TRANSFER_TYPEHASH,
                erc20TokenAddress,
                amount,
                fromAddress,
                toAddress,
                deadline
            ))
        )
    );
    address signer = ECDSA.recover(digest, signature);
    require(signer == fromAddress, "Invalid signature");
    
    IERC20 token = IERC20(erc20TokenAddress);
    token.safeTransferFrom(fromAddress, toAddress, amount);
}
```

### Option 3: Restrict Access to Trusted Callers

If this function is only meant to be called by other trusted contracts in the system:

```solidity
// Add access control
mapping(address => bool) public authorizedCallers;

function setAuthorizedCaller(address caller, bool authorized) external onlyOwner {
    authorizedCallers[caller] = authorized;
}

function payWithERC20(address erc20TokenAddress, uint256 amount, address fromAddress, address toAddress) public {
    require(authorizedCallers[msg.sender], "Unauthorized caller");
    require(fromAddress != toAddress, "Cannot transfer to self address");
    require(toAddress != address(0), "Invalid to address");
    require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
    
    IERC20 token = IERC20(erc20TokenAddress);
    token.safeTransferFrom(fromAddress, toAddress, amount);
}
```

By implementing one of these solutions, you can ensure that token transfers only occur when properly authorized, preventing transaction failures and improving the overall reliability of the system.
