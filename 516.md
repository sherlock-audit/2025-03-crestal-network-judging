# `payWithERC20` could be exploited due to `public` visibility

### Summary

`payWithERC20` is meant to be used to transfer tokens from users to the `feeCollectionWalletAddress`

However since the function is marked with `public` visibility,
anyone could call it and transfer tokens from any `fromAddress ` to any `toAddress`, 
as long as the `fromAddress ` has approved the contract to spend their tokens.

### Root Cause


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/Payment.sol#L25-L32

`payWithERC20` function has public visibility.


```solidity
    function payWithERC20(address erc20TokenAddress, uint256 amount, address fromAddress, address toAddress) public {
        // check from and to address
        require(fromAddress != toAddress, "Cannot transfer to self address");
        require(toAddress != address(0), "Invalid to address");
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        IERC20 token = IERC20(erc20TokenAddress);
        token.safeTransferFrom(fromAddress, toAddress, amount);
    }
```

### Attack Path

Attack Scenario : Token Drain

Assume USDC as an approved TokenAddress

1. An user (Bob) approves the contract to spend their 500 USDC tokens 

2. An attacker (Alice) calls `payWithERC20`, (since it is a `public` function)
specifying the 
Bob's address as `fromAddress `
and Alice's own address as `toAddress`.

`payWithERC20(USDC, 500 , BobAddr, AliceAdr) `

Bob drains Alice's tokens.

### Impact

Malicious actors can drain tokens from any address that has approved the contract.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement appropriate **access control** or mark the function `payWithERC20 ` as `internal `



```solidity
    function payWithERC20(address erc20TokenAddress, uint256 amount, address fromAddress, address toAddress) internal {
       
        require(fromAddress != toAddress, "Cannot transfer to self address");
        require(toAddress != address(0), "Invalid to address");
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        IERC20 token = IERC20(erc20TokenAddress);
        token.safeTransferFrom(fromAddress, toAddress, amount);
    } 
```
