# Missing ERC-20 Allowance Checks in payWithERC20

### Summary

Missing ERC-20 Allowance Checks in payWithERC20

### Root Cause

Location:

Payment.sol → payWithERC20
BlueprintCore.sol → createAgent, updateWorkerDeploymentConfigCommon

Issue:

Functions invoking payWithERC20 (e.g., createAgentWithToken, updateWorkerDeploymentConfig) do not verify whether the fromAddress has granted the contract sufficient allowance to spend their ERC-20 tokens.

In meta-transaction flows (e.g., createAgentWithTokenWithSig), the fromAddress is the signer, not the transaction submitter (msg.sender). If the signer hasn’t explicitly approved the contract, safeTransferFrom will fail, but only after the relayer has already paid gas costs.

createAgent Workflow (ERC-20 Path)
1. User Action:

Calls createAgentWithToken or createAgentWithTokenWithSig.

2. Validation:

Checks paymentAddressEnableMp[tokenAddress] (token is whitelisted).

Retrieves cost = paymentOpCostMp[tokenAddress][CREATE_AGENT_OP].

3. Payment:
Calls payWithERC20(tokenAddress, cost, userAddress, feeCollectionWalletAddress).

4. State Change:

Sets deploymentOwners[requestID] = userAddress.
Emits CreateAgent event.

Critical Gap:
No allowance check between steps 2 and 3. The contract assumes the user has pre-approved it to spend tokens, but this is never validated.

**payWithERC20 Implementation:**
```solidity
function payWithERC20(address erc20TokenAddress, uint256 amount, address fromAddress, address toAddress) public {
    IERC20 token = IERC20(erc20TokenAddress);
    token.safeTransferFrom(fromAddress, toAddress, amount); // Reverts if allowance < amount
}
```
-> While safeTransferFrom does check allowance internally, the failure occurs after the relayer has already initiated the transaction, incurring gas cost

### Internal Pre-conditions

None 

### External Pre-conditions

None 

### Attack Path

Context: Gasless meta-transaction via createAgentWithTokenWithSig.

1. Signs Request: Approves the action via EIP-712 signature but does not approve ERC-20 allowance.

2. Relayer Submits TX: Pays gas to execute createAgentWithTokenWithSig.

3. Execution Fails: At payWithERC20, due to insufficient allowance.

4. Result:

Relayer loses gas.

User’s transaction never completes, requiring manual intervention.

### Impact

Failed transactions waste relayers’ gas.
Poor UX for gasless flows, as users may not realize they need pre-approvals.
Financial loss for relayers, degraded UX, but no direct fund theft.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add explicit allowance checks before calling payWithERC20:

```solidity
function createAgent(...) internal {
    // Add this check:
    require(
        IERC20(tokenAddress).allowance(userAddress, address(this)) >= cost,
        "Insufficient ERC-20 allowance"
    );
    payWithERC20(tokenAddress, cost, userAddress, feeCollectionWalletAddress);
    // Proceed with agent creation...
}
```
