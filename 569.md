# Unintended Whitelisting of Non-Whitelisted Accounts in resetAgentCreationStatus Function

### Summary

The resetAgentCreationStatus function automatically assigns a Status.Issued state to any provided userAddress in the whitelistUsers mapping, regardless of whether the user was previously whitelisted. This introduces a critical vulnerability where unauthorized accounts can become whitelisted by invoking the function.

### Root Cause

The function directly updates the whitelistUsers mapping without verifying whether the userAddress is already part of the whitelist or if it qualifies for whitelisting.

```solidity
    function resetAgentCreationStatus(address userAddress, uint256 tokenId) public onlyOwner {
        whitelistUsers[userAddress] = Status.Issued;  //gives non whitelisted addresses whitelist access
        nftTokenIdMap[tokenId] = Status.Init;
    }
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

-Function is restricted so it is called by the  owner which goes ahead to give ordinary users whitelist privileges unknowingly
-Non whitelisted now have access to whitelist privileges


### Impact

ordianary users now have access to whitelist privileges

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement check in resetAgentCreationStatus  to see if a user is whitelisted account before resetting their variables.
