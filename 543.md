# Signature-based functions are not sufficiently restrictive

### Summary

The `BlueprintCore::createAgentWithSigWithNFT` function uses a signature to create an agent on behalf of another user. However, the signature does not account for critical arguments such as `privateWorkerAddress` and `tokenId`.

### Root Cause

The following functions validate the signature and restrict certain parameters when creating an agent on behalf of a beneficiary, but they do not enforce restrictions on all parameters. This allows arbitrary and unintended values for `privateWorkerAddress`, `tokenId`, and `tokenAddress` to be freely set by the caller.

### Internal Pre-conditions

* The caller possesses a signature expressing a transaction intent from a beneficiary.

### External Pre-conditions

*No Response*

### Attack Path

* The caller can use the signature to make calls that do not reflect the signer's original intent.

### Impact

* The caller can manipulate parameters such as privateWorkerAddress, making it a dummy or not.
* They can submit a different tokenId than the one intended by the signer.
* They may even use a different approved token than expected. (Even NFTs)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

* Strengthen restrictions by enforcing additional parameters within the beneficiary's signature.
