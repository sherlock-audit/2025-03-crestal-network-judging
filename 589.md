# Checking project existence solely by require(projects[projectId].id == 0) causes a special-case issue with bytes32(0)


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/27a3c28155702b3a68f29347efedffb048010e33/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L151
## Checking project existence solely by `require(projects[projectId].id == 0)` causes a special-case issue with `bytes32(0)`

In the code, there's a check such as:

```solidity
modifier newProject(bytes32 projectId) {
    require(projects[projectId].id == 0, "projectId already exists");
    _;
}
```

However, if someone provides `projectId` as `bytes32(0)` (a value of all zeros), it initially satisfies the condition (`projects[0].id == 0`). Later, when calling `setProjectId(projectId, userAddr)`, the assignment will again set `projects[0].id = 0`. But since this mapping's default is already 0, nothing effectively changesâ€”it remains zero.

In theory, this means users can repeatedly invoke `createProjectIDAndProposalRequest` with the zero ID (`bytes32(0)`) because the check `projects[0].id` always returns 0, and thus never throws an error. Unless explicitly assigning a non-zero value to `projects[0].id` (which the current code doesn't do), this special `projectId=0` creates a scenario for potential infinite overwriting or at least logical confusion.

Additionally, if your business logic genuinely allows a `projectId` to be zero, you need to carefully evaluate conflicts with the default mapping value of zero. If zero is undesirable as a valid ID, you should explicitly disallow it by adding a check like:

```solidity
require(projectId != bytes32(0), "invalid projectId");
```

This ensures clear logic and prevents ambiguity or misuse involving the special zero-value ID.
