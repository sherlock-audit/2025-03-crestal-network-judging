# Missing check if function caller is authorised or creator for that particular projectId in upgradeProject function attacker can reset values of anyone's projectId

### Summary

Due to missing check if function caller is authorised or creator for that particular projectId in [upgradeProject ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/27a3c28155702b3a68f29347efedffb048010e33/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L198C37-L198C46) function attacker can reset values of anyone's projectId leading to loss in access control and set values for that users

### Root Cause

Due to missing access control check for `projectId` entered in [upgradeProject](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/27a3c28155702b3a68f29347efedffb048010e33/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L198C37-L198C46) function attacker can reset values of anyone's projectId leading to loss in access control and set values of their `projectId` for that users

### Attack Path

1. User calls [createCommonProposalRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/27a3c28155702b3a68f29347efedffb048010e33/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L238) function by passing all the params as input and on success of that call `requestProposalID` value is set at [BluePrintCore.sol:L227](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/27a3c28155702b3a68f29347efedffb048010e33/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L227C29-L227C47) to `requestID` value generated.
2. Attacker calls `upgradeProject` function with above user's `projectId` value as param and `requestProposalID` value will be reset to 0 without any permission from user.

### Impact

Users suffer in loss of their project state due to missing access control checks in `upgradeProject` function in BluePrintCore.sol contract allowing attacker or anyone reset values of any user's project state leading to loss in data stored in variables in users project state breaking the functionality of protocol as explained in attack path.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Implement access control checks in [upgradeProject](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/27a3c28155702b3a68f29347efedffb048010e33/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L198C14-L198C28) function allowing only `projectId` owner or authorised party to call it.
