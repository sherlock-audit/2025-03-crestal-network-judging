# Due to projectIDs[projectId] != dummyAddress check present in hasProject modifier it will always revert all the functions where that modifier is present since projectIDs mapping is not getting set anywhere

### Summary

Due to projectIDs[projectId] != dummyAddress check present in hasProject modifier it will always revert all the functions where that modifier is present since projectIDs mapping is not getting set anywhere and value of dummyAddress is address(0) which will be by default value of address in projectIDs mapping leading to all those function inaccesible.

### Root Cause

In [BluePrintCore.sol:L165](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/27a3c28155702b3a68f29347efedffb048010e33/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L165C14-L165C24) due to `projectIDs[projectId] != dummyAddress` check present in hasProject modifier it will always revert all the functions where that modifier is present since projectIDs mapping is not getting set anywhere and value of dummyAddress is address(0) which will be by default value of address in projectIDs mappingleading to all those function inaccesible.

### Internal Pre-conditions

NA

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

1. Any user calling all the functions in which hasProject modifier is present will revert and all those functions will be inaccesible

### Impact

All the functions (For example - createProjectIDAndProposalRequest) where `hasProject` modifier is present will be inaccesible.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Remove `projectIDs[projectId] != dummyAddress` check from the hasProject modifier
