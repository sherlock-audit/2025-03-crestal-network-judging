# User Proposal Request ID Overwrite Leading to Loss of Historical Records

### Summary


The `proposalRequest` function in the BlueprintCore contract contains a design flaw in handling user proposal requests. When a user creates multiple projects and submits proposal requests for each project, each new request overwrites the previous value in `latestProposalRequestID[userAddress]`, resulting in an inability to track the user's proposal history.

### Root Cause

```solidity
function proposalRequest(
    address userAddress,
    bytes32 projectId,
    address solverAddress,
    string memory base64RecParam,
    string memory serverURL
) internal hasProject(projectId) returns (bytes32 requestID) {
    // ... code omitted ...
    
    /* @audit no check for userAddress, one userAddress can create many project,if userAddress already create 1 project, 
     when userAddress try to create another one, latestProposalRequestID[userAddress] would be rewrite
    */
    latestProposalRequestID[userAddress] = requestID;
    
    // ... code omitted ...
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

This issue can be verified with the following test case:
1. User creates two different projects
2. User submits proposal requests for each project
3. Verify that only the latest proposal request ID can be retrieved via `latestProposalRequestID`

### Impact

1. **Loss of Historical Records**: Users cannot access proposal request IDs for all their projects, only the most recent one.
2. **User Experience Issues**: Users who need to track proposals across multiple projects cannot directly query their past proposal requests from the contract.
3. **Potential Data Retrieval Difficulties**: Any backend systems that rely solely on the `latestProposalRequestID` mapping for user proposal history will encounter incomplete data.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Create Nested Mapping or Array Structure, Maintain an array or mapping of proposal request IDs for each user address.

```solidity
// Use an array to store all proposal request IDs for each user
mapping(address => bytes32[]) public userProposalRequestIDs;

// Add to proposalRequest function:
userProposalRequestIDs[userAddress].push(requestID);
```
