# Signature Replay in EIP712 Implementation

### Summary

The absence of nonce/replay protection in EIP712.sol will cause repeated execution of authorized operations for users as an attacker will capture and resubmit valid signatures multiple times for the same operation.

### Root Cause

In [EIP712.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/EIP712.sol#L10-L14) the typed data structures for `ProposalRequest` and `DeploymentRequest` lack essential replay protection mechanisms:

```solidity
bytes32 public constant PROPOSAL_REQUEST_TYPEHASH =
    keccak256("ProposalRequest(bytes32 projectId,string base64RecParam,string serverURL)");
bytes32 public constant DEPLOYMENT_REQUEST_TYPEHASH =
    keccak256("DeploymentRequest(bytes32 projectId,string base64RecParam,string serverURL)");
```

The functions `getRequestProposalDigest()` and `getRequestDeploymentDigest()` create digests that don't include any of the following:
1. Nonce
2. Deadline expiration
3. Any mechanism to invalidate used signatures

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user needs to sign a valid `ProposalRequest` or `DeploymentRequest` message for any legitimate operation
2. The implementation needs to use these signature verification functions without additional replay protection
3. The protocol needs to process operations based solely on valid signatures without tracking which signatures have been used

### External Pre-conditions

1. The attacker needs access to observe valid signatures on the blockchain (can be done through MEV or monitoring pending transactions)

### Attack Path

1. User creates and signs a valid message for a deployment or proposal request with specific parameters
2. User submits the transaction containing their signature to authorize an operation
3. Attacker captures the valid signature from the blockchain
4. Attacker resubmits the same signature in a new transaction
5. The contract accepts the signature as valid since the digest components remain identical
6. The operation is executed again, despite the user only authorizing it once
7. Steps 4-6 can be repeated indefinitely

### Impact

• Unauthorized agent creation using victim signatures leads to compromised account control `createAgentWithTokenWithSig`
• Financial exploitation through repeated token drains, NFT allowance abuse, and top-up depletion `createAgentWithSigWithNFT`
• Configuration sabotage via replay attacks against deployment settings, disrupting system operations `updateWorkerDeploymentConfigWithSig`

### Mitigation

Add replay protection to the EIP712 implementation:

```solidity
// Option 1: Add nonce to the type definitions
bytes32 public constant DEPLOYMENT_REQUEST_TYPEHASH =
    keccak256("DeploymentRequest(bytes32 projectId,string base64RecParam,string serverURL,uint256 nonce, uint256 expiry)");
```
