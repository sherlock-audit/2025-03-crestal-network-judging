# Whitelisted Users forced to own NFT to call the `createAgent` function

**Description:** according to the project design and guide provided, there is an inconsistent approach between project's design specification/guide and the way the `createAgentWithWhitelistUsers` function requires whitelisted users in the code. According to the design, whitelisted users should be able to create agents for free without an NFT requirement. The current implementation forces whitelisted users to provide a valid NFT token ID and proves ownership of that NFT, creating an unnecessary barrier for legitimate users.

**Impact:** 
This implementation flaw:

- Prevents legitimate whitelisted users from creating agents without owning an NFT
- Forces users to acquire NFTs unnecessarily, potentially incurring financial costs
- Restricts the access to a feature that should be available to whitelisted users

**Proof of Concept:**
```solidity
    function test_whitelistedUserWithoutNFTFails() public {
        // Add the test contract to the whitelist
        address[] memory whitelistAddresses = new address[](1);
        whitelistAddresses[0] = address(this);
        blueprint.setWhitelistAddresses(whitelistAddresses);
    
        // Check the user is whitelisted
        assertTrue(blueprint.isWhitelistUser(address(this)), "User is not in whitelist");
    
        
        // but it will fail with the current implementation
        vm.expectRevert("NFT token not owned by user");
        blueprint.createAgentWithWhitelistUsers(projectId, "base64Proposal", workerAddress, "url", 1);
    }
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** 
consider redesign the architecture in the `createAgentWithWhitelistUsers` function to Modify the `createAgentWithWhitelistUsers` function to bypass the NFT ownership check for whitelisted users.
