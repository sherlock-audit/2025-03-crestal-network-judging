# Missing Access Control in upgradeProject Function



### Description
The `upgradeProject()` function in the BlueprintCore contract completely lacks access control mechanisms. While the function includes a `hasProject` modifier to verify the project exists, there are no restrictions on who can call this function.

The function allows any caller to reset critical project information, including proposal and deployment request IDs and the proposed solver address, without any authorization checks.

### Vulnerability Details
The `upgradeProject` function is designed to reset project information, presumably as part of an upgrade process:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L198
```solidity
function upgradeProject(bytes32 projectId) public hasProject(projectId) {
    // reset project info
    projects[projectId].requestProposalID = 0;
    projects[projectId].requestDeploymentID = 0;
    projects[projectId].proposedSolverAddr = dummyAddress;
} 
```

The function only checks if the project exists (via the `hasProject` modifier) but does not verify if the caller (`msg.sender`) is authorized to perform this highly sensitive operation. This means any external actor who knows a valid project ID can reset critical project information.

### Impact
Any external actor can reset project information, effectively disrupting ongoing operations and potentially causing project failures. Basically reset the project parameters.


### Recommendation
Implement access control
