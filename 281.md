# Unauthorized Project Modification via upgradeProject Function

### Summary

The upgradeProject function allows anyone to reset project-related information without verifying ownership. This flaw enables unauthorized modification of any project, leading to potential data corruption and disruption

The function is marked public and does not include an ownership check. It does not verify whether the caller (msg.sender) is the actual project owner, making it possible for anyone to reset a projectâ€™s critical data.
