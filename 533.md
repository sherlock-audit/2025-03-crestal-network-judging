# Anyone can overwrite any project via `createProjectIDAndProposalRequest()`

### Summary

`createProjectIDAndProposalRequest()` can be used to overwrite an already existing project, which is detrimental to the protocol's integrity.

This lack of access control is destructive, because a user create a projectId with a associated deployment request id, but someone else can just call `createProjectIDAndProposalRequest()` and overwrite the deployment request id to its default value of 0

### Root Cause

Lack of access control that checks if a project is already existing

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Alice creates a new project for herself with a deployment request id to it
2. Bob sees that and calls `createProjectIDAndProposalRequest()` to overwrite the deployment request id to its default value of zero

### Impact

Lack of access control that destroys the integrity of the deployment request functionality - medium severity.
