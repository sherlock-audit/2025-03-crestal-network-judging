# BluePrint doesn't allow to get the reputation factor or modify this field

### Summary

In previous versions of BlueprintContract, the getReputation allowed to access the following field : 
mapping(address => uint256) public solverReputation;

This function allowed the realization of this api call : 
https://docs.crestal.network/api-reference/fetch-solver-details#fetch-solver-details

### Root Cause

In Blueprint.sol and BlueprintCore.sol, there is missing getReputation method.

The field solverReputation is never read or modified in the current version

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/27a3c28155702b3a68f29347efedffb048010e33/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L37

As the api is still existing, this reputation field will get outdated data or data unrelevant to the current context.

### Internal Pre-conditions

No internal conditions needed

### External Pre-conditions

No external conditions needed

### Attack Path

No attack path. Lack of function.

### Impact


// Breaks core contract functionality, rendering the contract useless or leading to loss of funds that's relevant to the affected party.

The reputation field will be incorrect. A user can be misled by this information. Also, all the new users will have a 0 reputation. As the choice of an agent is made upon reputation, a core functionality is lost (functionality was important, as an API was created specifically for this).

### PoC

The absence of a getReputation can not be seen with a POC.

### Mitigation

Add the getReputation and setReputation methods as the previous versions did.
