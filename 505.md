# Lack of Access Control in `upgradeProject` Function

**Summary**

The `BlueprintCore::upgradeProject` function lacks proper access control. Currently, any user can call this function to reset a project's `requestProposalID`, `requestDeploymentID`, and `proposedSolverAddr`. Allowing unauthorized modifications to projects.

```javascript

function upgradeProject(bytes32 projectId) public hasProject(projectId) {
        // reset project info
        projects[projectId].requestProposalID = 0;
        projects[projectId].requestDeploymentID = 0;
        projects[projectId].proposedSolverAddr = dummyAddress;
 }

```

**Impact**

1. Any malicious actor can invoke `upgradeProject` with a valid `projectId`.
2. They can reset project data, interfering with its functionality.


**Mitigation**

To prevent unauthorized access, restrict function execution to the project owner using appropriate access control.
