# Users can create agent without paying a cost

# Summary

The user can creates agent or updates the deployment config without paying a cost.

# Root Cause

The [`BlueprinV5`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/27a3c28155702b3a68f29347efedffb048010e33/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintV5.sol#L10) contract is upgradeable and uses a proxy for the deployment. The `BlueprintV5` is also a child contract of `Blueprint` and `BlueprintCore` contracts. The main functionslity with that the users interact is in the `BlueprintCore` contract. The admin functions are in the `Blueprint` function. The `initialize` function of the `BlueprintV5` is the following: 

```solidity

    function initialize() public reinitializer(5) {
        __Ownable_init(msg.sender);
        VERSION = "5.0.0";
        __EIP712_init(SIGNING_DOMAIN, VERSION);
        __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
    }

```

The [`Blueprint::setCreateAgentTokenCost`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/27a3c28155702b3a68f29347efedffb048010e33/crestal-omni-contracts/src/Blueprint.sol#L54) and [`Blueprint::setUpdateCreateAgentTokenCost`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/27a3c28155702b3a68f29347efedffb048010e33/crestal-omni-contracts/src/Blueprint.sol#L64) are used the owner to set the cost for creation and updating the agent. 
The problem is that the cost for these operations is 0 before the owner calls them. That means a user can call the functions `BlueprintCore::createAgentWithToken` and `BlueprintCore::updateWorkerDeploymentConfig` before the owner sets the cost and creates an agent without cost.

# Internal pre-conditions

The owner is set the payment address, but not the cost for create agent and update the worker deployment config.

# External pre-conditions

The user calls the ``BlueprintCore::createAgentWithToken`` and `BlueprintCore::updateWorkerDeploymentConfig` functions and creates agent/update the wroker deployment config without cost.

# Impact

The protocol will not receive the required cost from the user, if the user creates agent or updates the worker deployment config before the owner sets the cost for these operations.

# PoC

The following Foundry test shows how the user can call multiple time the `createAgentWithToken` function before the owner sets the agent creation cost. In that way the user can create agents without paying the required cost. This leads to protocol loss:

```solidity

    function testCreateAgentWithTokenWithoutCost() public {
        string memory base64Proposal = "test base64 proposal";
        string memory serverURL = "http://example.com";
        
        vm.prank(owner);
        blueprint.addPaymentAddress(address(erc20));

        vm.startPrank(user1);

        bytes32 projectId = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, msg.sender, block.chainid));
        bytes32 projectId1 = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp + 1, msg.sender, block.chainid));
        blueprint.createAgentWithToken(projectId, base64Proposal, address(0x00), serverURL, address(erc20));
        blueprint.createAgentWithToken(projectId1, base64Proposal, address(0x00), serverURL, address(erc20));
    }

```

# Mitigation

Set the required addresses and costs in the `BlueprintV5::initialize` function.
