# Unauthorized Token Transfers in payWithERC20 Function

### Summary

Any user with an allowance can transfer tokens from any address to any destination
The lack of proper authorization checks in payWithERC20 will cause unauthorized token transfers for users who have granted allowances as malicious actors will exploit the function to transfer tokens without specific transaction approval.

### Root Cause

 In [Payment.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/Payment.sol#L25) the `payWithERC20` function lacks proper authorization checks, allowing anyone to call the function and transfer tokens from any address that has granted allowance


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to have granted an allowance to any address for their ERC20 tokens
2. The `Payment` contract needs to be deployed and accessible

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Alice grants an allowance of 1000 USDC to a dApp (contract) for a specific purpose (e.g., to pay for a service)
2. Attacker notices this allowance through monitoring blockchain activity
3. Attacker calls `payWithERC20` with:
   - `erc20TokenAddress` = USDC contract address
   - `amount` = 1000 USDC
   - `fromAddress` = Alice's address
   - `toAddress` = Attacker's address
4. The function executes `token.safeTransferFrom(fromAddress, toAddress, amount)`
5. Alice's tokens are transferred to the attacker

### Impact

The users suffer a complete loss of funds for any tokens they have granted allowances for. The attacker gains these tokens directly with minimal effort.

### Mitigation

make sure the transaction is authorized by `fromAddress`
