# A user canâ€™t create multiple projects within the same block.timestamp.

## Summary
In the BlueprintCore contract, the users are not able to create multiple projects within the same block.timestamp.

## Root Cause
The function createProjectID() in BlueprintCore contract is expected to generate unique projectId. However, it just uses block.timestamp, msg.sender and block.chainid only. This combination will not be able to generate multiple unique projectId from the same user with the same block.timestamp.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/27a3c28155702b3a68f29347efedffb048010e33/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L189C14-L196
```solidity
    function createProjectID() public returns (bytes32 projectId) {
        // generate unique project id
        // FIXME: typically we shouldn't just use block.timestamp, as this prevents multi-project
        // creation during a single block - which shouldn't be impossible...
        projectId = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, msg.sender, block.chainid));


        setProjectId(projectId, msg.sender);
    }
```

## Impact
If a user desires to have multiple projects, the calls createProjectID() multiple times within the same block, the inputs (block.timestamp, msg.sender, block.chainid) might remain the same and the user will not be able to create all the desired projects. This limits the usability of the contract. 

## PoC
N/A.

## Mitigation
Consider using a nonce (counter) per user also for the generation of the projectId. The modified code may look like
```solidity
    function createProjectID() public returns (bytes32 projectId) {
        // generate unique project id
        // FIXME: typically we shouldn't just use block.timestamp, as this prevents multi-project
        // creation during a single block - which shouldn't be impossible...
        projectId = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, msg.sender, block.chainid, userNonce[msg.sender]++));));


        setProjectId(projectId, msg.sender);
    }
```
and include the mapping too.
```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) private userNonce;
```
