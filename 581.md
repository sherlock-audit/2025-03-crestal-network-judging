### Summary

In payment contract, there is PaywithERC20(), 

```solidity
   function payWithERC20(address erc20TokenAddress, uint256 amount, address fromAddress, address toAddress) 
    public {
        // check from and to address
        require(fromAddress != toAddress, "Cannot transfer to self address");
        require(toAddress != address(0), "Invalid to address");
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        IERC20 token = IERC20(erc20TokenAddress);
        token.safeTransferFrom(fromAddress, toAddress, amount);
    }
```

here in this function is public instead of internal, due to which anyone call this function and can take funds of all users who have given approval to this contract
