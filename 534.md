# Using block.timestamp for Unique ID Generation Leads to Collisions

### Summary

Relying solely on `block.timestamp` and limited parameters to generate a unique ID can result in potential duplicate hash values, causing creation failures or data conflicts. This poses a collision risk for users who require truly unique identifiers, as attackers or other users could submit multiple transactions with identical parameters within the same second, leading to repeated `projectId` or `requestID`.

### Root Cause

In the [createProjectID() / requestID generation code], the choice to rely on `block.timestamp` (with second-level granularity) alongside limited parameters such as `msg.sender` and `base64Param` does not guarantee uniqueness. Multiple transactions within the same block or the same second can produce collisions.

[Relevant code snippet](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L189)
```solidity
function createProjectID() public returns (bytes32 projectId) {
    // generate unique project id
    // FIXME: typically we shouldn't just use block.timestamp, as this prevents multi-project
    // creation during a single block - which shouldn't be impossible...
    projectId = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, msg.sender, block.chainid));

    setProjectId(projectId, msg.sender);
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. An attacker or user calls `createProjectID()` (or a similar function for generating requestIDs) repeatedly within the same second or block, using the same `base64Param`, `msg.sender`, and other parameters.
2. Because the `block.timestamp` (or block time) is the same for all calls, and other parameters remain identical, the `keccak256` input data does not change—thus producing the same hash value each time.
3. The contract attempts to record that hash as the new `projectId` or `requestID`, leading to conflicts over “duplicate IDs.” This can disrupt logic or cause transactions to fail if the contract enforces a “no duplicate IDs” requirement.

### Impact

Users cannot reliably generate unique IDs within the same second or block. This can lead to transaction failures (e.g., `revert("already exists")`) or ID collisions that break the expected logic flow.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Use a **sequential counter or nonce**—maintain a global or user-specific counter in the contract and incorporate it into the hashing parameters. This ensures that even multiple calls within the same second will produce distinct IDs.
