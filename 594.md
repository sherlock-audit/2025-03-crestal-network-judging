# Unauthorized Agent Creation via NFT Ownership Check


## Summary

The lack of state update in the NFT ownership check will cause unlimited free agent creation for the protocol as an attacker will exploit a reentrancy race condition. In this attack path, an NFT holder can reuse the same NFT by transferring it between addresses within the same transaction block, thereby bypassing the one-agent-per-NFT restriction and flooding the agent registry.

## Root Cause

In `Payment.sol`, the function `checkNFTOwnership` only performs a one-time, read-only check of NFT ownership without updating any on-chain state. In `BlueprintCore.sol`, during the execution of `createAgentWithNFT`, no mechanism exists to record that an NFT has already been used. As a result, an attacker can transfer the NFT and reuse it within the same transaction block.

## Internal Pre-conditions

1. The NFT holder calls `createAgentWithNFT` with a valid NFT token id while it is in the unused state (for example, mapped as `Status.Init`).
2. The NFT ownership is checked via `checkNFTOwnership`, which is only a view function and does not update on-chain state before making the external call.
3. The NFT can be transferred within the same block, allowing its repeated reuse.

## External Pre-conditions

1. The external NFT contract allows rapid transfers, meaning transfers can occur within the same block.
2. Network conditions, such as block ordering and transaction front-running, enable an attacker to quickly transfer the NFT to another wallet in the same block.

## Attack Path

1. The NFT owner initiates a transaction calling `createAgentWithNFT` with a valid NFT token id to create a free agent.
2. During the same transaction block, the attacker transfers the NFT from the original ownerâ€™s wallet to a second address.
3. The attacker, using the new address, calls `createAgentWithNFT` again with the same NFT token id.
4. By repeating this process, the attacker bypasses the one-agent-per-NFT restriction and creates multiple agents for free.

## Impact

The protocol suffers a significant threat to its tokenomics and resource allocation. Unlimited free agent creation can lead to severe dilution of the intended agent creation cost structure, DoS by flooding the system with free agents, and economic losses due to misuse of protocol resources without proper cost recovery.

## Mitigation

To prevent this attack, modify the `createAgentWithNFT` function to update the NFT usage mapping immediately before making any external calls. For example, add the following check and state update at the beginning of the function:

```solidity
require(nftTokenIdMap[tokenId] == Status.Init, "NFT token id already used");  
nftTokenIdMap[tokenId] = Status.Pickup;  
require(checkNFTOwnership(nftContractAddress, tokenId, msg.sender), "NFT token not owned by user");
```
