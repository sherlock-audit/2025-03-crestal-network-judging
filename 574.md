# Unauthorized Token Transfers Will Enable Attackers to Drain User Funds

### Summary

A critical vulnerability in the `payWithERC20` function allows attackers to exploit excessive token approvals, resulting in unauthorized fund transfers. Without proper validation of the `fromAddress`, attackers can drain user funds by calling the function directly.

### Root Cause

The primary issue lies in the `payWithERC20` functionâ€™s lack of verification for the `fromAddress`. Since the function allows an attacker to specify any `fromAddress`, it becomes possible to exploit users who have previously approved the contract to spend their tokens.

```solidity
    function payWithERC20(address erc20TokenAddress, uint256 amount, address fromAddress, address toAddress) public {
        // check from and to address
        require(fromAddress != toAddress, "Cannot transfer to self address");
        require(toAddress != address(0), "Invalid to address");
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        IERC20 token = IERC20(erc20TokenAddress);
        token.safeTransferFrom(fromAddress, toAddress, amount);
    }
```

The `Blueprint` contract inherits the `Payment` contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

- User needs to approve the ERC20 token to the `Blueprint` contract.

### Attack Path

1. The user approves token to the `Blueprint` contract.
2. The attacker calls `payWithERC20` with `fromAddress` as the user address and `toAddress` as their address.

### Impact

- Attackers can steal user funds by specifying victim addresses as the `fromAddress` in `payWithERC20` calls.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Make the function internal.
