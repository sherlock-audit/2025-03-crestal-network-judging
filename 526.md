# public `payWithERC20(...)` function allows attacker to transfer approver's funds to himself

### Summary

public `payWithERC20(...)` function allows attacker to transfer users' funds who approved `blueprint` to himself

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/Payment.sol#L25
The choice of making `payWithERC20(...)` public instead of internal is a conceptual mistake.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User approved `blueprint` `x` amount of token `XYZ`

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Attacker see the approval since the tx has been processed and is public
2. Attacker calls `payWithERC20(address(XYZ), x, fromAddress, toAddress)`with `fromAddress` the address of the user and `toAddress` his address

### Impact

Loss of funds for the users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

`payWithERC20(...)` should be internal instead of public
