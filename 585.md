# Users Are Limited to One Proposal Request, Preventing Multiple Projects.

### Summary

The current implementation restricts users to a single proposal request at a time, which prevents them from creating multiple projects. This limitation arises because the `latestProposalRequestID` is a global tracker for each user, leading to the overwriting of previous requests.

### Root Cause

In `src/BlueprintCore.sol`, the `latestProposalRequestID` mapping is used to store the most recent proposal request ID for each user. When a user attempts to create a new proposal request, the existing request ID is overwritten, preventing the user from having multiple active requests.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user can call the createCommonProposalRequest function to create a proposal request.
2. The function generates a new request ID and assigns it to latestProposalRequestID[userAddress].

### External Pre-conditions

1. The user must have a valid project ID to create a proposal request.

### Attack Path

1. A user creates a proposal request for a project, which generates a unique request ID and stores it in latestProposalRequestID.
2. The user then attempts to create a second proposal request for a different project.
3. The new request ID overwrites the previous one stored in latestProposalRequestID, effectively losing the reference to the first request.

### Impact

Users are unable to manage multiple projects simultaneously, as they can only have one active proposal request at a time. This is a limitation as users may need to create multiple proposals for different projects.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the implementation to allow users to maintain multiple proposal requests. This can be achieved by using a mapping that associates each project ID with its corresponding request ID, rather than using a single global tracker for each user. This way, users can create and manage multiple projects without overwriting previous requests.
