# Unauthorized Worker Assignment In `BlueprintCore` Leads to Deployment Denial of Service

### Summary

`BlueprintCore` allows any address to claim deployment requests through the `submitDeploymentRequest` function without proper verification. Once claimed, there's no mechanism to reassign or reset the worker address stored in the mapping `requestDeploymentStatus`, which can lead to permanent denial of service if a malicious actor claims deployment requests and never completes them.

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/27a3c28155702b3a68f29347efedffb048010e33/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L607C1-L616C11

```solidity
    function submitDeploymentRequest(bytes32 projectId, bytes32 requestID)
        public
        hasProject(projectId)
        returns (bool isAccepted)
    {
        require(requestID.length > 0, "requestID is empty");
        require(requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status != Status.Init, "requestID does not exist");
        require(
            requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status != Status.Pickup,
            "requestID already picked by another worker, try a different requestID"
        );

        require(
            requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status != Status.GeneratedProof, "requestID has already submitted proof"
       // @audit - no require check that you are a verified worker in system
        );
```

The `submitDeploymentRequest` function lacks proper access controls, allowing any address to claim deployment tasks without verification against the contract's worker registry.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/27a3c28155702b3a68f29347efedffb048010e33/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L65

```solidity
    address[] private workerAddresses;
```

While the contract maintains a list of verified workers in the `workerAddresses` array, this registry is not utilized during worker assignment, creating a critical security gap.
### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract allows any address to call `submitDeploymentRequest` without verifying the array `workerAddresses` which stores valid workers
2. Once a worker is assigned to a deployment request, this assignment cannot be reassigned or reset

### External Pre-conditions

1.Existence of deployment requests on the platform for malicious user to intercept first


### Attack Path

1. A legitimate user creates a project and requests a deployment
2. The attacker monitors for deployment request events
3. The attacker calls `submitDeploymentRequest` for the target deployment
4. The attacker never calls `submitProofOfDeployment`, leaving the deployment in a permanent "in progress" state

### Impact

1. Permanent denial of service for specific deployment requests
2. Users are unable to deploy their AI agents
3. The platform's core functionality is directly impacted
4. Malicious actors could systematically block majority or all of deployments, effectively shutting down the platform

### PoC

Place this test inside of `BlueprintV5.t.sol`

```solidity
    address public alice = makeAddr("alice");
    address public bob = makeAddr("bob");

    function test_deployRequestDoS() public {
        string memory base64Proposal = "test base64 proposal";
        string memory serverURL = "http://example.com";
        bytes32 userProjectId = 0x488d55436254f74bb961add2134792044c6216fc21f4f2d070bf062a6a5d1754;

        bytes32 requestID = blueprint.createProjectIDAndDeploymentRequest(
            userProjectId,
            base64Proposal,
            serverURL
        );

        // 0x56ded7273da5a5f4291c34b990a4341b8c2f37d30959bc56fcab937c86918ac7
        console.logBytes32(requestID);

        vm.prank(alice);
        blueprint.submitDeploymentRequest(
            0x488d55436254f74bb961add2134792044c6216fc21f4f2d070bf062a6a5d1754,
            0x56ded7273da5a5f4291c34b990a4341b8c2f37d30959bc56fcab937c86918ac7
        );
        (,address worker) = blueprint.requestDeploymentStatus(requestID);
        console.log("Worker address for requestDeploymentStatus mapping for requestId's deployWorkerAddr:", worker);
        assertEq(worker, alice);

        // Alice who isn't a registered worker now decides to never call submitProofOfDeployment leaving it in limbo
        // User can't reset the worker address as it's already, and upgradeProject doesn't work to reset it
        // Leaving it forever stuck from a malicious user
        blueprint.upgradeProject(userProjectId);

        vm.expectRevert();
        vm.prank(bob);
        blueprint.submitDeploymentRequest(
            0x488d55436254f74bb961add2134792044c6216fc21f4f2d070bf062a6a5d1754,
            0x56ded7273da5a5f4291c34b990a4341b8c2f37d30959bc56fcab937c86918ac7
        );
    }
```

### Mitigation

Implement proper access control for workers inside of `submitDeploymentRequest` using `workerAddresses` or creating a mapping with a boolean value to save gas on an array loop, which would involve more changes in code base.
