# Actions with signatures don't verify all the inputs allowing the submitter of the transaction to freely decide what token or nft ID to use

### Summary

When action are performed on behalf of the user through a signature, crucial input parameters are left for the submitter to use, this will result in unexpected results.

### Root Cause

In functions such as [createAgentWithTokenWithSig](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L491-L492) the submiter of the transaction is left with the responsibility to decide which token to use. 


```solidity
function createAgentWithTokenWithSig( //@note no deadline on signature 
        bytes32 projectId,
        string memory base64Proposal,
        address privateWorkerAddress,
        string memory serverURL,
        address tokenAddress,
        bytes memory signature
    ) public returns (bytes32 requestID) {
        require(tokenAddress != address(0), "Token address is empty");

        // get EIP712 hash digest
        bytes32 digest = getRequestDeploymentDigest(projectId, base64Proposal, serverURL); 

```

We can see that the digest only has the 3 elements `projectId, base64Proposal, serverURL` which means that submitter can chose what token to use. In the case where prices are outdated, and the signer would like for another token to be used, there is actually no way to do so . 

When the signers transactions goes through, they're not explicitly approving which token should be used for payment. The transaction submitter can freely choose any token address when calling the function.
The security implications:

If token prices fluctuate, the submitter could choose whichever token is most advantageous to them
The signer has no way to restrict which tokens are acceptable for a specific transaction

This issue also applies with [createAgentWithSigWithNFT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L566-L567), there is no control over which nft to use.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Transaction is signed by user

### External Pre-conditions

Price volatility of tokens or nft.

If expensive nft gets used it will cause a loss
If token prices increased compared to USDC, and the token is used, it will cause a loss

### Attack Path

-Transaction is signed, no token may be specified
-Unwanted token or NFT is used for that transaction 

### Impact

The signing user will be exposed to randomness as he is not in control of which token or nft should be used

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

make the signature more specific:

```diff
    function createAgentWithSigWithNFT( //@note I can bypass whitelisting 
        bytes32 projectId,
        string memory base64Proposal,
        address privateWorkerAddress,
        string memory serverURL,
        bytes memory signature,
        uint256 tokenId
    ) public returns (bytes32 requestID) {
        // get EIP712 hash digest
-        bytes32 digest = getRequestDeploymentDigest(projectId, base64Proposal, serverURL);
+        bytes32 digest = getRequestDeploymentDigest(projectId, base64Proposal, serverURL, tokenId);
```
