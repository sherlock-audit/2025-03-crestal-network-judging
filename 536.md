# Improper State Validation in Proof of Deployment Submission

### Summary

The `submitProofOfDeployment()` function in [BlueprintCore.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L584) fails to validate the proper sequence of deployment states before accepting a proof as valid. The function allows workers to submit deployment proofs without verifying that the deployment has actually been completed, permitting state transitions from any state (except `Init` and `GeneratedProof`) directly to `GeneratedProof`.

### Root Cause

The root cause is inadequate state validation in the `submitProofOfDeployment()` function. While the function validates that the request exists and hasn't already submitted a proof, it critically fails to check whether the deployment has progressed through the proper state sequence before accepting a proof.

The contract defines a `Status` enum with a clear progression sequence:
```solidity
enum Status {
    Init,
    Issued,
    Pickup,
    Deploying,
    Deployed,
    GeneratedProof
}
```

**However, the function only checks:**

1. The request exists (`status != Status.Init`)
2. The caller is the assigned worker
3. A proof hasn't already been submitted (`status != Status.GeneratedProof`)

It omits verifying that the current status is `Status.Deployed`, which should be a prerequisite for submitting a proof of deployment.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- A deployment request has been created (status is not `Init`)
- The caller is the assigned deployment worker
- The request hasn't already submitted a proof

### External Pre-conditions

- A malicious or mistaken worker has access to a valid deployment request
- The worker can call the `submitProofOfDeployment()` function

### Attack Path

1. An worker/attacker who has been assigned as a deployment worker for a request (status = `Pickup` or `Deploying`) can skip the actual deployment process
2. The attacker directly calls `submitProofOfDeployment()` with any arbitrary proof data
3. The function accepts the proof and sets the status to `GeneratedProof` despite the deployment not being completed
4. The system now incorrectly considers the deployment as complete with valid proof

### Impact

- **Integrity Breach:** False deployments can be marked as complete with fabricated proofs
- **Service Disruption:** Users relying on actual deployments will be affected when services don't exist
- **Reputation Damage:** The platform's reliability is compromised if it certifies incomplete deployments
- **Financial Impact:** Potential payment for incomplete work or resource allocation based on false deployment data

### PoC

```solidity
// Assuming we have access to the contract
function exploitStateBypass(BlueprintCore contract, bytes32 projectId, bytes32 requestId) public {
    // Step 1: Become a worker for this request by submitting to it
    contract.submitDeploymentRequest(projectId, requestId);
    
    // At this point, the status is only "Pickup", not "Deployed"
    
    // Step 2: Submit a proof without doing actual deployment
    string memory fakeProof = "base64EncodedFakeProofData";
    contract.submitProofOfDeployment(projectId, requestId, fakeProof);
    
    // Vulnerability: The status is now "GeneratedProof" even though
    // we skipped the "Deploying" and "Deployed" states
    
    // Verification: Check the final status
    (, Status status) = contract.requestDeploymentStatus(requestId);
    assert(status == Status.GeneratedProof); // This should succeed, demonstrating the vulnerability
}
```

### Mitigation

add a specific status check to ensure proper state progression:
```solidity
function submitProofOfDeployment(bytes32 projectId, bytes32 requestID, string memory proofBase64)
    public
    hasProject(projectId)
{
    require(requestID.length > 0, "requestID is empty");
    require(requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status != Status.Init, "requestID does not exist");
    require(requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].deployWorkerAddr == msg.sender, "Wrong worker address");
    require(requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status != Status.GeneratedProof, "Already submitted proof");
    
    // Add this critical check to ensure proper state progression
    require(
        requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status == Status.Deployed,
        "Deployment must be completed before submitting proof"
    );

    // set deployment status into generatedProof
    requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status = Status.GeneratedProof;

    // save deployment proof to mapping
    deploymentProof[requestID] = proofBase64;

    emit GeneratedProofOfDeployment(projectId, requestID, proofBase64);
}
```

**This ensures that only deployments that have properly reached the Deployed state can submit proofs, maintaining the integrity of the deployment process.**
