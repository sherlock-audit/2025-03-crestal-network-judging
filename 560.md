# Users risk losing all approved funds due to unrestricted token transfer function

### Summary

The lack of access control in the `payWithERC20` function will cause unauthorized transfers of tokens for users as an attacker can exploit the allowance mechanism to transfer tokens from any user who has approved the contract.

### Root Cause

In `src/Payment.sol`, the `payWithERC20` function is publicly accessible without any checks to ensure that the caller is the owner of the `fromAddress`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Any user can call the `payWithERC20` function with a valid `fromAddress` and `toAddress`.
2. The `fromAddress` must have approved the contract to spend the specified amount of tokens.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The `fromAddress` must have a sufficient balance of the ERC20 tokens.
2. The `fromAddress` must have granted an allowance of at least X (e.g., 100,000) tokens to the contract.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker identifies users who have approved the contract to spend large amounts of tokens.
2. The attacker calls the `payWithERC20` function with:
    - `erc20TokenAddress`: Address of the ERC20 token.
    - `amount`: Any amount up to the approved limit (e.g., 100,000).
    - `fromAddress`: The address of a user who has granted approval.
    - `toAddress`: The attacker's address.
3. The function executes, transferring the specified amount of tokens from the user to the attacker.
4. This process can be repeated for any user who has approved the contract, allowing the attacker to potentially steal all approved funds from multiple users.

### Impact

Users suffer a loss of tokens due to unauthorized transfers initiated by the attacker. The attacker can steal all approved funds from all users who have granted allowances to the contract, leading to significant losses for those users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement access control mechanisms to ensure that only the owner of the tokens can initiate a transfer. This can be achieved by modifying the function to include checks that verify the caller is the same as the `fromAddress` or has explicit permission to initiate the transfer on behalf of the `fromAddress`.
