# Any user can create agents at zero cost through uninitialized token payment parameters

### Summary

The design choice to separate token registration from cost configuration creates a recurring vulnerability window that can cause financial loss for the protocol, as users can create agents at zero cost during the window between token registration and cost configuration. This vulnerability is particularly acute during the V4 to V5 upgrade transition, because concept of token cost is new to V5, but also exists whenever new tokens are added as payment methods.

### Root Cause

The core vulnerability stems from multiple design choices in the payment system:

1. In Blueprint.sol, the [addPaymentAddress](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/Blueprint.sol#L46-L52) function only registers a token as valid but does not set any costs
2. The [setCreateAgentTokenCost](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/Blueprint.sol#L54-L62) function must be called separately to set non-zero costs
3. In the [createAgent](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L461-L465) function, token payments are only enforced if the cost is greater than zero:
   ```solidity
   uint256 cost = paymentOpCostMp[tokenAddress][CREATE_AGENT_OP];
   if (cost > 0) {
       // payment to crestal wallet address with token
       payWithERC20(tokenAddress, cost, userAddress, feeCollectionWalletAddress);
   }
   ```
4. During the V4 to V5 upgrade, payment parameters are initialized to their default values (0), creating an immediate vulnerability window
5. Even after the initial upgrade, this vulnerability persists each time a new token is added as a payment method

### Internal Pre-conditions


1. A token address must be registered using `addPaymentAddress` but without setting costs with `setCreateAgentTokenCost`
2. The user must have the token registered with `addPaymentAddress` to pass validation
3. This vulnerability can occur in two scenarios:
   - During the initial upgrade from V4 to V5 when payment systems are introduced
   - Any time a new token payment address is added to the system


### External Pre-conditions

No external preconditions are necessary for this attack.

### Attack Path


### Scenario 1: Exploitation during V4 to V5 upgrade

1. Attacker monitors for the contract upgrade transaction from V4 to V5
2. After the upgrade completes, they observe the contract owner calling `addPaymentAddress(tokenAddress)` to register the first payment token
3. Before the owner calls `setCreateAgentTokenCost(tokenAddress, amount)`, the attacker:
   - Calls `createAgentWithToken` with the registered token address and otherwise arbitrary params
4. The function succeeds because:
   - The token is registered and passes the `paymentAddressEnableMp[tokenAddress]` check
   - The cost value `paymentOpCostMp[tokenAddress][CREATE_AGENT_OP]` is still 0 (default value)
   - The code path `if (cost > 0)` is not executed, skipping the payment requirement

### Scenario 2: Exploitation during routine token addition

1. Attacker monitors for transactions to the BlueprintV5 contract
2. Attacker observes the contract owner calling `addPaymentAddress(newTokenAddress)` to register a new token
3. Before the owner calls `setCreateAgentTokenCost(newTokenAddress, amount)`, the attacker:
   - Calls `createAgentWithToken` with the newly registered token address and otherwise arbitrary params
4. The function succeeds for the same reasons as in Scenario 1

### Impact


The protocol suffers financial loss in the form of missed revenue. The key issues are:

1. Users can create agents without paying any costs that would normally be applied to agent creation
2.  The protocol loses potential revenue that would have been collected through proper payment channels
    - Lost Revenue = Number of Agents Created Ã— Intended Creation Cost
3. An arbitrary number of agents can be created during the window between token registration and cost configuration
4. This vulnerability can be exploited repeatedly with each new payment token added to the system
The financial impact depends on the intended cost of agent creation, but it represents a complete bypass of the payment mechanism during administrative operations.

This is particularly concerning because:
1. Token registration happens during initial setup and whenever new payment options are added
2. The window of opportunity exists until admin explicitly configures costs
3. Sophisticated attackers can monitor for token registration events and respond rapidly with prepared transactions
4. During the V4 to V5 upgrade, this vulnerability affects the entire payment system at once

Note: This vulnerability extends beyond agent creation and also affects the agent update functionality. The same zero-cost token vulnerability exists in updateWorkerDeploymentConfig, allowing deployment owners to update their agent configurations without paying the required update fees, further amplifying the potential for revenue loss.

### PoC


The following test demonstrates the vulnerability, paste it into the protocols existing `BlueprintUpgradeTest.t.sol` test file:

```solidity
function test_ZeroCostTokenAgentAfterV5Upgrade() public {
    // First perform the standard V4 to V5 upgrade (reusing existing test logic)
    test_UpgradeV4();
    
    // Upgrade to V5
    BlueprintV5 blueprintV5 = new BlueprintV5();
    vm.startPrank(proxy.owner());
    proxy.upgradeToAndCall(address(blueprintV5), abi.encodeWithSignature("initialize()"));
    vm.stopPrank();
    
    // Verify upgrade was successful
    assertEq(proxy.VERSION(), "5.0.0");
    
    // Setup test user and token
    address user = address(0xBEEF);
    address mockToken = address(0x123456);
    
    // Mock a token implementation
    vm.etch(mockToken, bytes("ERC20"));
    
    // First the admin adds a payment token (but doesn't set cost yet)
    vm.startPrank(proxy.owner());
    // Set fee collection wallet
    BlueprintV5(address(proxy)).setFeeCollectionWalletAddress(address(0xFEE));
    // Add payment token
    BlueprintV5(address(proxy)).addPaymentAddress(mockToken);
    vm.stopPrank();
    
    // User immediately exploits the zero-cost window
    vm.startPrank(user);
    
    // Create agent with token - no cost is enforced yet!
    bytes32 requestId = BlueprintV5(address(proxy)).createAgentWithToken(
        "arbitrary-projectID-abc123",
        "zero cost agent creation due to uninitialized cost",
        address(0),  // No private worker
        "app.crestal.network",
        mockToken
    );
    
    // Verify agent was created successfully
    assertTrue(requestId != bytes32(0));
    
    vm.stopPrank();
    
    console.log("Successfully demonstrated zero-cost agent creation vulnerability in payment system");
}
```

### Mitigation


Consider implementing the following layers of protection:

1. **Add a global payment system enablement flag**:
   ```solidity
   // Add to contract state
   bool public paymentSystemEnabled;
   
   // Function to enable payment system only after full configuration
   function enablePaymentSystem(bool enabled) public onlyOwner {
       paymentSystemEnabled = enabled;
   }
   
   // Modify createAgentWithToken to check
   function createAgentWithToken(...) public returns (bytes32 requestID) {
       require(tokenAddress != address(0), "Token address is empty");
       require(paymentSystemEnabled, "Payment system is not enabled");
       // existing code...
   }
   ```

2. **Combine token registration with cost setting**:
   ```solidity
   function addPaymentAddressWithCost(
       address paymentAddress, 
       uint256 createCost, 
       uint256 updateCost
   ) public onlyOwner {
       require(paymentAddress != address(0), "Payment Address is invalid");
       require(createCost > 0, "Create cost must be greater than zero");
       require(updateCost > 0, "Update cost must be greater than zero");
       
       paymentAddressesMp[PAYMENT_KEY].push(paymentAddress);
       paymentAddressEnableMp[paymentAddress] = true;
       paymentOpCostMp[paymentAddress][CREATE_AGENT_OP] = createCost;
       paymentOpCostMp[paymentAddress][UPDATE_AGENT_OP] = updateCost;
       
       emit PaymentAddressAdded(paymentAddress);
       emit CreateAgentTokenCost(paymentAddress, createCost);
       emit UpdateAgentTokenCost(paymentAddress, updateCost);
   }
   ```

3. **Add a safety check in `createAgentWithToken`**:
   ```solidity
   function createAgentWithToken(...) public returns (bytes32 requestID) {
       //...existing code...
       require(paymentOpCostMp[tokenAddress][CREATE_AGENT_OP] > 0, "Token creation cost not set");
       //...existing code...
   }
   ```

4. **Implement atomic initialization during upgrade**: Add a specific initialization function for V5 that sets up the payment system in a single transaction:
   ```solidity
   function initializePaymentSystem(
       address feeWalletAddress,
       address[] calldata initialTokens,
       uint256[] calldata createCosts,
       uint256[] calldata updateCosts
   ) public onlyOwner {
       require(!paymentSystemEnabled, "Payment system already initialized");
       require(initialTokens.length == createCosts.length && initialTokens.length == updateCosts.length, "Array length mismatch");
       
       feeCollectionWalletAddress = feeWalletAddress;
       
       for (uint256 i = 0; i < initialTokens.length; i++) {
           paymentAddressesMp[PAYMENT_KEY].push(initialTokens[i]);
           paymentAddressEnableMp[initialTokens[i]] = true;
           paymentOpCostMp[initialTokens[i]][CREATE_AGENT_OP] = createCosts[i];
           paymentOpCostMp[initialTokens[i]][UPDATE_AGENT_OP] = updateCosts[i];
       }
       
       paymentSystemEnabled = true;
   }
   ```

These mitigations provide multiple layers of protection:
1. A global enablement flag prevents any token-based agent creation until the system is fully configured
2. Combined token and cost registration prevents the vulnerability window
3. Explicit cost validation provides a secondary safety check
4. Atomic initialization during upgrade addresses the transition vulnerability
