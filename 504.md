# Incomplete Removal of Token Address from paymentAddressesMp Array in removePaymentAddress Function

### Summary

The removePaymentAddress function fails to fully remove the specified payment address from the paymentAddressesMp array. While the function marks the address as disabled in the paymentAddressEnableMp mapping, it does not ensure that the address is removed from the array.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the incomplete implementation of the removePaymentAddress function. The function only disables the payment address in the paymentAddressEnableMp mapping but does not delete it from the paymentAddressesMp array. 
When tokens are added to the protocol the addPaymentAddress() is utilized which sets payment addresses as true and also adds them to the  paymentAddresesMp array

```solidity
 function addPaymentAddress(address paymentAddress) public onlyOwner {
        require(paymentAddress != address(0), "Payment Address is invalid");
  =>      paymentAddressesMp[PAYMENT_KEY].push(paymentAddress); //address pushed to array
        paymentAddressEnableMp[paymentAddress] = true;

        emit PaymentAddressAdded(paymentAddress);
    }
```

However when they are removed using the  removePaymentAddress() they are only set as false and removed from the paymentAddressesMp[PAYMENT_KEY] mapping

```solidity
function removePaymentAddress(address paymentAddress) public onlyOwner {
        require(paymentAddress != address(0), "Payment Address is invalid");

        require(paymentAddressEnableMp[paymentAddress], "Payment Address is not added");

        // soft remove
        paymentAddressEnableMp[paymentAddress] = false;

        emit RemovePaymentAddress(paymentAddress);
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

 getPaymentAddresses() is a public function which is used to know the payment addresses accepted by the protocol but since the function will also return tokens that have blackilisted. User will be denied when trying to create agents by transfering tokens
```solidity
function getPaymentAddresses() public view returns (address[] memory) {
        return paymentAddressesMp[PAYMENT_KEY];
    }
```

### Impact

Denial of service

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

remove blacklisted tokens from paymentAddressesMp[PAYMENT_KEY] array in the removePaymentAddress() function
