# DOS in submitDeploymentRequest() through front-run

### Summary

The submitDeploymentRequest function is susceptible to front-running attacks due to the lack of mechanisms to prioritize or secure deployment requests. A malicious actor can exploit this vulnerability by monitoring the network and submitting their request first, effectively blocking legitimate requests and resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) for deployment operations.

### Root Cause

The function operates on a "first come, first serve" basis without implementing any protective measures such as cryptographic commitment schemes, thereby allowing malicious actors to front-run deployment requests.

the function is called by a malicious party which leads to the deployWorkerAddr been set to the malicious actor's address

malicious actor with no intent of deploying request calls submitDeploymentRequest with a valid project's id below which sets the malicious actor's address as the deployWorkerAddr .  project  can no longer be deployed as the function also sets the status has been picked up already
```solidity
function submitDeploymentRequest(bytes32 projectId, bytes32 requestID)
        public
        hasProject(projectId)
        returns (bool isAccepted)
    {
        require(requestID.length > 0, "requestID is empty");
        require(requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status != Status.Init, "requestID does not exist");
        require(
            requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status != Status.Pickup,
            "requestID already picked by another worker, try a different requestID"
        );

        require(
            requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status != Status.GeneratedProof, "requestID has already submitted proof"
        );

        // currently, do first come, first server, will do a better way in the future
        requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status = Status.Pickup;
        requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].deployWorkerAddr = msg.sender;// malicious actor front-runs

        // set project deployed worker address
        isAccepted = true;

        emit AcceptDeployment(projectId, requestID, requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].deployWorkerAddr);
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

-malicious actor calls the submitDeploymentRequest() with a valid project's Id and thereby Denying deployemnt permanently
-this can't be reversed as there is no function to update deploy worker address

### Impact

Denial of sevrice,  Non-whitelisted users also lose funds as they utilized their monies in create agents

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure that  submitDeploymentRequest() can only be called by authorized worker addresses
