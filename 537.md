# updateWorkerDeploymentConfig Reverts the GeneratedProof State to Pickup

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L628
The following code exists in the contract:
```solidity
if (requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status == Status.GeneratedProof) {
    requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status = Status.Pickup;
}
```
This means once a deployment request has moved to the GeneratedProof state (indicating the worker has already submitted proof), someone with deployment permission (deploymentOwners[requestID]) can revert its status back to Pickup. This causes two critical issues:

The worker's previously submitted proof becomes meaningless (wasted effort).
Prone to logical conflicts: If the original intended workflow was
Worker submits proof → GeneratedProof → Verification, reverting to Pickup after proof submission allows the proof submission to be ignored.
If business logic indeed requires repeated configuration updates, a more rigorous mechanism is needed—such as creating new deployment requests rather than reverting an already-submitted proof state. The current logic can cause serious logical defects.
