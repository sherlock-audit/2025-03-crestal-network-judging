# Users can cancel each other's proposal requests

### Summary

This is possible due to the permissionless nature of the [`BluePrintCore::upgradeProject`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L198) function. When a user create propolsal request, his `projects[projectId].requestProposalID` variable is changed with the newly computed `requestId`, as seen here:
```solidity
    function proposalRequest(
        address userAddress,
        bytes32 projectId,
        address solverAddress,
        string memory base64RecParam,
        string memory serverURL
    ) internal hasProject(projectId) returns (bytes32 requestID) {
        require(bytes(serverURL).length > 0, "serverURL is empty");
        require(bytes(base64RecParam).length > 0, "base64RecParam is empty");

        // generate unique hash
        requestID = keccak256(
            abi.encodePacked(
                block.timestamp,
                userAddress,
                base64RecParam,
                block.chainid
            )
        );

        // check request id is created or not
        // if it is created, then we need to lock it, not allow user to trigger proposal request again
        // slither-disable-next-line incorrect-equality,timestamp
        require(
            projects[projectId].requestProposalID == 0,
            "proposal requestID already exists"
        );

        // FIXME: This prevents a msg.sender to create multiple requests at the same time?
        // For different projects, a solver is allowed to create one (latest proposal) for each.
        latestProposalRequestID[userAddress] = requestID;

@>        projects[projectId].requestProposalID = requestID;
```
The thing here is that everybody can call the `upgradeProject` function, bringing `requestProposalID` back to 0. ultimately making it impossible for a regular user to create and maintain proper proposal request

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is the permissionless nature of the `upgradeProject` function

### Internal Pre-conditions

User creating a proposal request

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. user creates proposal request
2. malicious user sees this and calls `upgradeProject` on his `projectId`

### Impact

User being unable to create proposal requests. Same thing happens with deployment requests but since they can be made directly from `createAgent` function and there is a state change in the `requestDeploymentStatus` mapping, the impact is not that significant 

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Add `creator` to the project struct and require this creator to call the `upgradeProject` function for it to not revert
