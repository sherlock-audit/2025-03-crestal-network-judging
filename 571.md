# Missing Ownership Verification in Project Upgrade Function

### Summary

The upgradeProject function in [BlueprintCore.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L198) lacks ownership verification, allowing any user to reset critical project state variables of any existing project. This vulnerability enables unauthorized modifications that can cause denial of service, data loss, and potentially financial loss depending on the project state.

### Root Cause

The function implements basic existence verification through the hasProject modifier but completely lacks access control to verify the caller is the legitimate project owner before allowing critical state changes.
```solidity
// @audit this function doesnt check the owner of the project
function upgradeProject(bytes32 projectId) public hasProject(projectId) {
    // reset project info
    projects[projectId].requestProposalID = 0;
    projects[projectId].requestDeploymentID = 0;
    projects[projectId].proposedSolverAddr = dummyAddress;
}
```
The contract tracks project ownership through the latestProjectID mapping, but fails to utilize it for authorization in this sensitive function.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The target project must exist (enforced by hasProject modifier)
- No authentication or ownership verification is required
- The projects mapping must be accessible

### External Pre-conditions

- The attacker needs to know a valid project ID
- No financial requirements or special permissions needed

### Attack Path

1. An attacker identifies a target project ID by monitoring CreateProjectID events or through other means
2. The attacker calls upgradeProject(targetProjectID)
3. The hasProject modifier confirms the project exists and allows execution
4. The function resets critical project state variables without checking if the caller owns the project
5. The legitimate project data (proposal ID, deployment ID, and solver address) is permanently lost

### Impact

- Data Loss: Critical project information is permanently reset
- Denial of Service: Ongoing deployments and proposals are disrupted
- Business Logic Disruption: Project workflows are broken mid-process
- Potential Financial Loss: If projects have associated financial operations or if fees were paid for proposals/deployments
- User Experience Degradation: Project owners must restart their projects from scratch

### PoC

check attack path

### Mitigation

Implement proper ownership verification by checking that the caller is the project owner:
```solidity
function upgradeProject(bytes32 projectId) public hasProject(projectId) {
    // Check ownership - the caller must be the project owner
    require(latestProjectID[msg.sender] == projectId, "Only project owner can upgrade project");
    
    // reset project info
    projects[projectId].requestProposalID = 0;
    projects[projectId].requestDeploymentID = 0;
    projects[projectId].proposedSolverAddr = dummyAddress;
}
```

Additionally:

1. Consider implementing a role-based access control system for more granular permissions
2. Add events to log project upgrades for auditability
3. Consider implementing a time-lock for sensitive operations to provide a window for detecting unauthorized changes
