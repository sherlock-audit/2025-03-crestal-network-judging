# Incorrect Order of Operations Leading to User Lockout

Summary:
The `createAgentWithWhitelistUsers` and `createAgent` functions update user status or NFT token status before completing agent creation. If subsequent steps fail, users/NFTs are locked out.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/27a3c28155702b3a68f29347efedffb048010e33/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L521

Vulnerability Details:

This finding accurately identifies a state management issue where a user status is updated before the operation completes successfully. This creates a potential permanent lockout scenario.

In `createAgentWithWhitelistUsers`, `whitelistUsers[msg.sender]` is set to `Status.Pickup` before invoking `createAgent`. If `createAgent` reverts, the user's status remains Pickup, preventing future agent creation.

In `createAgent`, when using an NFT, `nftTokenIdMap[tokenId]` is set to `Status.Pickup` before deployment. If deployment fails, the NFT is marked as used despite no agent being created.

Exploitability:
A failing `createAgent` call results in an irreversible state update, permanently preventing affected users or NFTs from being used again.
No mechanism exists to reset the state or recover from failure.
The impact is severe for users, as they lose access to agent creation, which is a critical function in the ecosystem.

Recommended Fix:
Update the status only after the operation completes successfully, using a check-effects-interactions pattern:

```solidity
function createAgentWithWhitelistUsers(...) public returns (bytes32 requestID) {
    // Check whitelist status
    require(whitelistUsers[msg.sender] != Status.Init, "User is not in whitelist");
    require(whitelistUsers[msg.sender] != Status.Pickup, "User already created agent");
    
    // Create agent first
    requestID = createAgent(...);
    
    // Update status only after successful creation
    whitelistUsers[msg.sender] = Status.Pickup;
}
```
