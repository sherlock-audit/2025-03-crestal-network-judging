# Parent contract `BlueprintCore` is missing storage gap

### Summary

`BlueprintV5` is intended to be a upgradeable contract, but it inherit `BlueprintCore` that is does not have storage gap implemented

### Root Cause

`BlueprintV5` is inheriting `Blueprint` which inheriting `BlueprintCore`, the root cause because `BlueprintCore` does not have upgradeable contract library imported then it should explicitely state the storage gap in the contract to maintain the storage layout.

This is the snippet of [BlueprintV5.sol#L10](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintV5.sol#L10) [Blueprint.sol#L7](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/Blueprint.sol#L7) and [BlueprintCore.sol#L8](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L8)
```Solidity
contract BlueprintV5 is Initializable, UUPSUpgradeable, OwnableUpgradeable, Blueprint {

contract Blueprint is OwnableUpgradeable, BlueprintCore {

contract BlueprintCore is EIP712, Payment {
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

by making changes inside `BlueprintCore` especially adding new variables then the upgrade contract would be likely cause storage collision that can be corrupting child contract state and potentially making the whole contract unusable

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add the missing gap in the `BlueprintCore`:

```Solidity
uint256[50] private __gap;  
```
