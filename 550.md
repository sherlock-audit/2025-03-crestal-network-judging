# Unauthorized Access to upgradeProject Causes Project State Reset

### Summary

Due to missing access control, any user can call upgradeProject and reset key project state variables. This enables malicious actors to disrupt project operations, impacting legitimate owners.

### Root Cause

The function upgradeProject updates critical project parameters without verifying whether the caller is authorized. The hasProject modifier only ensures that the project exists but does not enforce ownership restrictions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Project Must Exist: The targeted projectId must be associated with an active project.
No Ownership Validation: The function does not check whether the caller is the actual project owner.

### External Pre-conditions

Any blockchain user with network access can invoke upgradeProject with a valid projectId.


### Attack Path

The attacker identifies an existing projectId belonging to another user.
The attacker executes upgradeProject(projectId), even though they have no legitimate control over it.
The function resets key project parameters (requestProposalID, requestDeploymentID, proposedSolverAddr), effectively erasing its configuration.
The rightful owner loses control over their project, leading to disruptions or service failures.

### Impact

 The projectâ€™s operational state is wiped, forcing the owner to reconfigure it from scratch. Attackers can exploit this flaw to interfere with multiple projects.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify upgradeProject to ensure only the project owner (or an authorized account) can execute it.
