# Upgradeability Gap Between BlueprintCore and BlueprintV5

### Summary

- The lack of upgradeability design in BlueprintCore.sol will cause state corruption for the protocol as the owner will upgrade BlueprintCore with a conflicting storage layout.

### Root Cause

- In BlueprintCore.sol, the contract is not designed as upgradeable (no Initializable inheritance), while BlueprintV5.sol uses the UUPS pattern, creating a potential storage layout mismatch.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The owner needs to deploy BlueprintV5 with BlueprintCore as part of the inheritance chain.
- The owner needs to upgrade BlueprintCore to a new version with additional state variables.

### External Pre-conditions

- None required.

### Attack Path

- Owner deploys BlueprintV5 with the current BlueprintCore implementation.
- Owner upgrades BlueprintCore to a new version that adds a new state variable (e.g., uint256 newVariable) at the top of the storage layout.
- The new variable overlaps with existing variables (e.g., VERSION in BlueprintCore), corrupting the state of BlueprintV5.

### Impact

- The protocol suffers state corruption, potentially leading to incorrect behavior or loss of data integrity.

### PoC

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../BlueprintV5.sol";
import "../BlueprintCore.sol";

contract UpgradeabilityGapTest is Test {
    BlueprintV5 blueprintV5;
    address owner = address(0x1);

    function setUp() public {
        blueprintV5 = new BlueprintV5();
        vm.startPrank(owner);
        blueprintV5.initialize();
        vm.stopPrank();
    }

    function test_StorageCorruption() public {
        // Conceptual PoC: Simulate a new BlueprintCore with added state
        // Actual testing requires proxy deployment and upgrade
        // This demonstrates the potential for corruption
        vm.startPrank(owner);
        // Simulate adding a new variable in BlueprintCore (e.g., uint256 newVariable)
        // This would overlap with existing variables (e.g., VERSION)
        // In a real upgrade, this would corrupt state
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

- Make BlueprintCore upgradeable:

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";
contract BlueprintCore is Initializable, EIP712, Payment {
    function initialize() public initializer {
        // Initialization logic
    }
}
```
