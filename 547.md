# NFT Ownership Transfer Prevents New Owner from Creating an Agent

### **Summary**  
The current implementation causes an issue where an NFT used to create an agent is permanently marked as `Status.Pickup` in the `nftTokenIdMap`. When the NFT is transferred to a new owner, the status is not updated, preventing the new owner from utilizing the NFT to create an agent. This leads to a restriction on the intended functionality for newly acquired NFTs.

### **Root Cause**  
- In the `createAgent` function, the following check prevents the reuse of an NFT:
  ```solidity
  require(nftTokenIdMap[tokenId] != Status.Pickup, "NFT token id already used");
  ```
- Once an agent is created, the status of the NFT is permanently set to `Status.Pickup`:
  ```solidity
  nftTokenIdMap[tokenId] = Status.Pickup;
  ```
- The contract does **not** update or reset this status when the NFT is transferred to a new owner. As a result, the new owner is unable to use the NFT for agent creation.

---

### **Impact**  
- **New Owner Locked Out:** The new owner of the NFT is unable to use it for creating an agent, despite having legal ownership.
- **Unintended Restriction:** The functionality of NFTs, which are intended to be transferable and reusable assets, is restricted due to the permanent status marking.

### **Proof of Concept (PoC)**  
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

contract TestNFTAgentLock {
    BlueprintCore blueprint; // Instance of the vulnerable contract

    constructor(address blueprintAddress) {
        blueprint = BlueprintCore(blueprintAddress);
    }

    function testNFTAgentLock(
        uint256 tokenId,
        bytes32 projectId,
        string memory base64Proposal,
        address privateWorkerAddress,
        string memory serverURL
    ) external {
        // User A creates an agent with NFT tokenId
        blueprint.createAgentWithNFT(projectId, base64Proposal, privateWorkerAddress, serverURL, tokenId);

        // Simulate NFT transfer: User A transfers NFT tokenId to User B off-chain.

        // User B attempts to create an agent with the NFT, but this fails
        blueprint.createAgentWithNFT(projectId, base64Proposal, privateWorkerAddress, serverURL, tokenId);
        // This transaction will revert due to the "NFT token id already used" error.
    }
}
```

### **Recommended Fixes**  
1. **Check Ownership Dynamically:** Modify the `createAgent` function to verify NFT ownership at the time of agent creation, using the NFT contract itself rather than the `nftTokenIdMap`:
   ```solidity
   require(checkNFTOwnership(nftContractAddress, tokenId, msg.sender), "NFT token not owned by user");
   ```
   This ensures that only the current owner of the NFT can create an agent.

2. **Implement a Status Reset Mechanism:** Introduce a function to allow the new owner to reset the `nftTokenIdMap` entry upon receiving the NFT:
   ```solidity
   function resetNFTStatus(uint256 tokenId) external {
       require(checkNFTOwnership(nftContractAddress, tokenId, msg.sender), "NFT not owned by sender");
       nftTokenIdMap[tokenId] = Status.Init; // Reset status to allow reuse
   }
   ```
   This would allow the new owner to reuse the NFT without requiring manual intervention from the contract owner.
