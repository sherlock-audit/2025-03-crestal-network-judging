# Unrestricted Worker Public Key Registration

### Summary

The lack of access control in setWorkerPublicKey will cause a disruption of proposal and deployment workflows for legitimate users as an attacker will spam the worker list with fake registrations.



### Root Cause

In the Crestal Network smart contract, the setWorkerPublicKey function lacks any restriction on who can call it, allowing any Ethereum address to register a worker public key. This design choice is a mistake as it enables unauthorized entities to populate the worker list with invalid or malicious entries.

// set worker public key
    function setWorkerPublicKey(bytes calldata publicKey) public {
        if (workersPublicKey[msg.sender].length == 0) {
            workerAddressesMp[WORKER_ADDRESS_KEY].push(msg.sender);
        }
        workersPublicKey[msg.sender] = publicKey;
    }

### Internal Pre-conditions

The attacker needs to call setWorkerPublicKey to set workerAddressesMp to include their address.

The workerAddressesMp mapping must be modifiable by the setWorkerPublicKey function with no restrictions.



### External Pre-conditions

The Ethereum network must be operational to allow the attacker to submit transactions.

Gas prices must be affordable for the attacker to execute multiple calls to setWorkerPublicKey.



### Attack Path

1. The attacker calls setWorkerPublicKey with a random or junk publicKey.

2. The function registers the attacker's address in the workerAddressesMp array and associates the publicKey with it in the workersPublicKey mapping.

3. The attacker repeats this process using multiple addresses or junk data to flood the worker list with fake entries.



### Impact

The legitimate users suffer disruptions in proposal and deployment workflows due to a polluted worker list. The attacker does not directly gain value but can influence worker selection or disrupt fair task allocation, effectively griefing the system.

        for (uint i = 0; i < 100; i++) {

        }
        // Verify worker list is flooded (add assertions as needed)
    }
}

contract CrestalNetwork {
    mapping(address => bytes32) public workersPublicKey;
    address[] public workerAddressesMp;

    function setWorkerPublicKey(bytes32 publicKey) public {
        workersPublicKey[msg.sender] = publicKey;
        workerAddressesMp.push(msg.sender);
    }
}

### Mitigation

Implement Access Control: Restrict setWorkerPublicKey to a whitelisted set of addresses or require a staking mechanism (e.g., locking tokens) to deter spam.
