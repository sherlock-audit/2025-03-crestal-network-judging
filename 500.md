# Unauthorized Agent Control After NFT Transfer


---

### **Summary**
A vulnerability exists in the `BlueprintCore` smart contract where the original owner of an NFT can retain control over an agent even after transferring the NFT to a new owner. This occurs because the contract does not invalidate the agent or update its state when the NFT is transferred. As a result, the original owner can continue to perform agent-related duties (e.g., updating configurations, submitting proof, and controlling deployment status), while the new owner is locked out from creating a new agent with the same NFT. This issue undermines the integrity of the system and can lead to abuse, financial loss, and operational disruption.

### **Vulnerability Details**

1. **One-Time Ownership Check**:
   - The contract checks NFT ownership only during agent creation (`createAgent`).
   - It does not verify ongoing ownership when the agent is accessed or modified.

2. **No Invalidation on NFT Transfer**:
   - The contract does not listen for NFT transfer events or update its state when an NFT is transferred.
   - As a result, the `deploymentOwners` mapping and `nftTokenIdMap` remain tied to the original owner.

#### **Steps to Reproduce**
1. **Alice Creates an Agent**:
   - Alice owns NFT `tokenId = 123`.
   - She calls `createAgent`, and the contract:
     - Checks her ownership of the NFT.
     - Maps `tokenId = 123` to her address in `nftTokenIdMap` and `deploymentOwners`.
     - Creates the agent and sets its status to `Status.Pickup`.

2. **Alice Transfers the NFT to Bob**:
   - Alice transfers the NFT to Bob. Now, Bob is the rightful owner of `tokenId = 123`.
   - However, the contractâ€™s state is not updated:
     - `nftTokenIdMap[123]` still points to Alice.
     - `deploymentOwners[requestID]` still points to Alice.

3. **Bob Tries to Create an Agent**:
   - Bob calls `createAgent` with `tokenId = 123`.
   - The contract checks `nftTokenIdMap[123]` and sees that it is already `Status.Pickup` (used by Alice).
   - The transaction fails with the error: `"NFT token id already used"`.

4. **Alice Retains Control**:
   - Even though Alice no longer owns the NFT, she can still:
     - Call `updateWorkerDeploymentConfigCommon` to modify the deployment configuration.
     - Call `submitProofOfDeployment` to submit proof for the deployment.
     - Influence the deployment status and emit events.

### **Impact**

#### **1. Unauthorized Control Over Agents**
- The original owner (Alice) can continue to perform agent-related duties, even after transferring the NFT.
- This includes:
  - Updating deployment configurations.
  - Submitting proof of deployment.
  - Influencing deployment status.

#### **2. New Owner is Locked Out**
- The new owner (Bob) cannot create a new agent with the NFT because the `tokenId` is still marked as used by the original owner.

Although there is a mechanism for mitigating against tokenID being used multiple times, after transfer of NFTs users can still maintain agent status and perform agent duties without having the NFT

### **Recommendations**

#### **1. Invalidate Agents on NFT Transfer**
- Integrate with the NFT contract to listen for `Transfer` events.
- When an NFT is transferred, invalidate the associated agent by:
  - Resetting `nftTokenIdMap[tokenId]` to `Status.Init`.
  - Removing the original owner from `deploymentOwners`.

Example:
```solidity
function onNFTTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) external {
    require(msg.sender == nftContractAddress, "Only NFT contract can call this");

    // Invalidate the agent if the NFT is transferred
    if (nftTokenIdMap[tokenId] == Status.Pickup) {
        nftTokenIdMap[tokenId] = Status.Init; // Reset status
        // Optionally, mark the agent as invalid
    }
}
```

#### **2. Continuously Verify NFT Ownership**
- Check NFT ownership whenever an agent is accessed or modified.
- For example, before allowing `updateWorkerDeploymentConfigCommon` or `submitProofOfDeployment`, verify that the caller still owns the NFT.

```solidity
function updateWorkerDeploymentConfigCommon(
    address tokenAddress,
    address userAddress,
    bytes32 projectId,
    bytes32 requestID,
    string memory updatedBase64Config
) internal hasProject(projectId) {
    require(requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status != Status.Init, "requestID does not exist");
    require(bytes(updatedBase64Config).length > 0, "updatedBase64Config is empty");
    require(requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status != Status.Issued, "requestID is not picked up by any worker");

    // Check NFT ownership if the agent was created with an NFT
    if (deploymentOwners[requestID] == userAddress && nftTokenIdMap[tokenId] == Status.Pickup) {
        require(checkNFTOwnership(nftContractAddress, tokenId, userAddress), "NFT token not owned by user");
    }

    // Rest of the function logic...
}
```
