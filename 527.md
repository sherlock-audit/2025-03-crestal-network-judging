# The system is unable to edit `paymentOpCostMp`

### Summary

The system is unable to edit `paymentOpCostMp`, this means every action that is supposed to be able to have an associated cost is unable to have such cost.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is that there is no function to edit the [paymentOpCostMp](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L97-L98) mapping. This mapping is vital to edit specifc costs. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L461

```solidity
 uint256 cost = paymentOpCostMp[tokenAddress][CREATE_AGENT_OP];
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L646

```solidity
uint256 cost = paymentOpCostMp[tokenAddress][UPDATE_AGENT_OP];
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

none needed

### External Pre-conditions

none needed

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

The protocol will suffer from loss of potential gain as it will be unable to impose a fee for given actions

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce a function able to edit the mapping related to the costs of actions
