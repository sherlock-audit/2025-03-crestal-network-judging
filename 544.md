# Lack of access control on upgradeProject leads into any user able to reset other users project

### Summary

Lack of access control in `upgradeProject` function in `BlueprintCore` can lead into any user reseting project data of others not owned projects. This leads into malicious users disrupting ongoing operations on other users’ project configurations.

### Root Cause

upgradeProject lack of checks to verify if the caller actually owns the project that he’s trying to upgrade/reset.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/27a3c28155702b3a68f29347efedffb048010e33/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L198

```solidity
function upgradeProject(bytes32 projectId) public hasProject(projectId) {
    // reset project info
    projects[projectId].requestProposalID = 0;
    projects[projectId].requestDeploymentID = 0;
    projects[projectId].proposedSolverAddr = dummyAddress;
}

```

The `hasProject` modifier checks for `projectId` existence, but not if the caller is authorized but not for ownership validation:

```solidity
modifier hasProject(bytes32 projectId) {
    // projectId backwards compatibility
    //    projects[projectId].id != 0 --> false --> new project id created by new blueprint not exist
    //    projectIDs[projectId] != address(0) -- > false -- >. old project id created by old blueprint not exist.
    //    both 1 and 2 are false, then project id does not exist in old and new blueprint
    require(projects[projectId].id != 0 || projectIDs[projectId] != dummyAddress, "projectId does not exist");
    _;
}

```

### External Pre-conditions

_No Response_

### Attack Path

1. A legitimate user creates a project with `createProjectID()`
2. The user initiates a proposal request and/or deployment request
3. A malicious actor calls `upgradeProject(victimProjectId)`
4. All important project state is reset:
    - `requestProposalID` is set to 0
    - `requestDeploymentID` is set to 0
    - `proposedSolverAddr` is set to `dummyAddress`
5. The victim's project loses all its progress and configurations

### Impact

User can have their projects reseted at any time by any other user without any pre conditions. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Add a mapping to project creation to keep track of project owners
- Add a check to `upgradeProject` to verify the caller is actually the owner of the project being upgraded.
