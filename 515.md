# Missing access control restriction in `upgradeProject ` function could be exploited

### Summary

The `upgradeProject ` function is liekly intended to allow project owners or admins to
reset a project to its initial state (e.g., if a proposal or deployment fails).


This function effectively resets the project's state, 
clearing any existing proposal, deployment, and solver information.

requestProposalID → Set to 0.
requestDeploymentID → Set to 0.
proposedSolverAddr → Set to dummyAddress.

The vulnerability stems from the fact that the current implementation of `upgradeProject ` function lacks access control and allows anyone to reset these values repeatedly.

### Root Cause

Contract : `BlueprintCore`

Missing access control, event emission in `upgradeProject` function 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L198-L203

```solidity

    function upgradeProject(bytes32 projectId) public hasProject(projectId) {
        // reset project info
        projects[projectId].requestProposalID = 0;
        projects[projectId].requestDeploymentID = 0;
        projects[projectId].proposedSolverAddr = dummyAddress;
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

_1. Identify Active Projects:_

An attacker scans the blockchain for active projects (e.g., by listening to CreateProjectID events).

_2. Call upgradeProject:_

The attacker calls upgradeProject on all active projects with `projectIDs `, resetting their state.


> requestProposalID → Set to 0.
> requestDeploymentID → Set to 0.
> proposedSolverAddr → Set to dummyAddress.


### Impact

Here are some ways it can be exploited:

An attacker can call `upgradeProject ` on any active project, resetting its state.

This could:

- Cancel ongoing proposal or deployment requests.
- Remove the assigned solver, disrupting the project's workflow.
- Cause confusion or delays for legitimate users , leading to frustration and potential financial losses.


**Denial of Service (DoS)**

Attackers could repeatedly call `upgradeProject `on all projects IDs, 
effectively making the system unusable.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement appropriate access control in `upgradeProject` function. 
Such as allowing only the project's initial creator (msg.sender) to upgrade it.
This will require another mapping to track the original proposer of the project ID.
Also, emit events to track changes transparently.

```solidity

modifier onlyValidProposer (bytes32 projectId) {
    require(projects[projectId].proposer == msg.sender, "Not project creator");
    _;
}


function upgradeProject(bytes32 projectId) public hasProject(projectId) onlyValidProposer(projectId) {

    projects[projectId].requestProposalID = 0;
    projects[projectId].requestDeploymentID = 0;
    projects[projectId].proposedSolverAddr = dummyAddress;

    emit ProjectUpgraded(projectId, msg.sender);                            // < -- emit event
}
```
