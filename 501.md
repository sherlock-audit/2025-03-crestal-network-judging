# Invalid Worker Address Results in Irreversible NFT Consumption in `BlueprintCore::createAgent`

**Summary:** 

Lack of checks to ensure the validity of the provided worker address during agent creation could result in user losing the benefit of free agent creation on providing incorrect private worker address.

**Description:** 

The protocol allows users to create an AI agent by consuming an NFT under a strict "1 NFT, 1 agent" policy. Users may specify a private worker address to handle the agent creation. However, there is no check to ensure its validity. Once the `createAgentXXXWithNFT` is triggered, the status of the NFT is changed in [createAgent](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L449),

```javascript

    function createAgent(
        address userAddress,
        bytes32 projectId,
        string memory base64Proposal,
        address privateWorkerAddress,
        string memory serverURL,
        uint256 tokenId,
        address tokenAddress
    ) internal returns (bytes32 requestID) {
        if (tokenAddress == address(0)) {
            // create agent with nft
            // check NFT token id is already used or not
@>          require(nftTokenIdMap[tokenId] != Status.Pickup, "NFT token id already used");

            // check NFT ownership
            require(checkNFTOwnership(nftContractAddress, tokenId, userAddress), "NFT token not owned by user");
            requestID = createCommonProjectIDAndDeploymentRequest(
                userAddress, projectId, base64Proposal, privateWorkerAddress, serverURL
            );

            // update NFT token id status
@>          nftTokenIdMap[tokenId] = Status.Pickup;

            // set deployment owner
            deploymentOwners[requestID] = userAddress;

            // emit create agent event
            emit CreateAgent(projectId, requestID, userAddress, tokenId, 0);
        } else {
            ...
            ...
        }
        ...
    }

```

If a user submits a transaction to create an agent but provides an invalid or non-functional worker address (e.g., typo, unresponsive/failed worker node), the protocol will immediately mark the NFT as "consumed" upon transaction submission, even if the worker fails to process the request or that, the provided address is incorrect.

There is no way for users or the protocol team to correct the worker address after that. That means, the benefit that comes with it is lost and the NFT is essentially wasted in the process resulting in user going for the second option; pay to create which the user could've gotten without paying unnecessary cost.

**Impact:** 

Loss of NFT benefits due to unfortunate circumstances.

**Recommended Mitigation:** 

Consider adding worker address mapping for validation or delay NFT consumption until worker confirmation.
