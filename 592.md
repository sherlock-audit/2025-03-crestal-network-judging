# Workers Can Impersonate Others by Setting Public Keys of Different Workers

### Summary

The lack of verification in the `setWorkerPublicKey` function allows malicious workers to set fake public keys, enabling them to impersonate legitimate workers. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized project submissions and actions taken under the guise of another worker's identity.

### Root Cause

In `src/BlueprintCore.sol`, the `setWorkerPublicKey` function does not verify that the public key being set actually belongs to the worker calling the function. This oversight allows any worker to set any public key, including those of other workers.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Any worker can call the `setWorkerPublicKey` function.
2. The worker must provide a public key as input.

### External Pre-conditions

There are no external checks or validations on the public key being set.

### Attack Path

1. A malicious worker calls the `setWorkerPublicKey` function and provides a public key that belongs to another worker.
2. The function executes without any verification, allowing the malicious worker to set a public key that could be used for signing transactions or messages as if they were the legitimate worker.
3. The malicious worker can then submit projects or perform actions that should only be available to the legitimate worker, leading to unauthorized project submissions

### Impact

The ability for workers to set fake public keys enables malicious actors to impersonate legitimate users, allowing them to submit projects and execute actions as if they were someone else. A private request for a specific project/agent can be carried out by an unauthorized worker.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a verification mechanism to ensure that the public key being set corresponds to the worker's identity. This could involve requiring a signature from the worker's private key to confirm ownership of the public key before allowing it to be set. Additionally, consider implementing access controls to restrict sensitive actions to verified identities only.
