# `mapping userTopUpMp` is not used anywhere except the place in which balance is added

### Summary

Purpose of `userTopUp() is for the user to topup balance before he does some operation, so he has something like a receipt to show and assigns the balance in the `mapping userTopUpMp`.

The issue stems from this - the mapping itself is used nowhere, thus when a user tops his balance, he can't use it nor retrieve it, thus complete loss of funds for him

### Root Cause

`mapping userTopUpMp` is used nowhere, which is wrong as it defeats the purpose of it existing

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Alice tops up her balance via `userTopUp()`
2. Alice then has no way of using that topped up balance, or retrieving her tokens, leading to stuck funds

### Impact

Funds are stucked without any way of them being utilized, as well as broken functionality

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use the mapping in a function which requires payments from the user
