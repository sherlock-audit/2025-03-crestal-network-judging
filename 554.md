# Lack of Access Control in upgradeProject Function Leading to Dos

### Summary

The upgradeProject function does not implement any access control, allowing any user to invoke it. Consequently, this can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) for legitimate users, as it resets critical project-related IDs to zero.

### Root Cause

The absence of role-based access control or ownership verification in the upgradeProject function permits any external caller to execute it, regardless of their authorization. This vulnerability allows arbitrary resetting of project state data, disrupting functionality.

```solidity
function upgradeProject(bytes32 projectId) public hasProject(projectId) {//no access control can be reset by anyone
        // reset project info
        projects[projectId].requestProposalID = 0;
        projects[projectId].requestDeploymentID = 0;
        projects[projectId].proposedSolverAddr = dummyAddress;
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

A simple call to upgradeProject function will reset all values

### Impact

the proposal Id, requestDeploymentiD and solver address which are data's needed to sort out deployement are lost leading to permanent DOS  for example solver address is changed to dummy address which leads to a revert in the below function

```solidity
  function createCommonDeploymentRequest(
        address userAddress,
        bytes32 projectId,
        address solverAddress,
        address workerAddress,
        string memory base64Proposal,
        string memory serverURL
    ) internal returns (bytes32 requestID) {
        require(solverAddress != dummyAddress, "solverAddress is not valid");

```



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add access control to upgradeProject
