# Lack of Nonce in the signature can cause Replay Attacks and Front-Running

### Summary

The signature validation functions used in the `BlueprintCore.sol` contract does not uses an incremental nonces mechanism when signing a message as this could cause the signature to be replayed or to be front runned.

### Root Cause

The problem is that the signature is checked only for the signer when a message is signed with any of the function that requires a signature validation in the `BlueprintCore.sol` contract . All the function should check for the nonce of the signer when validating a transaction but it is not done in the contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. a user need to sign a message and use a function that requires the signature.

### External Pre-conditions

users that are likely to front run the transaction

### Attack Path

1. a user signs a message and creates an agent with the function `createAgentWithTokenWithSig()`
2. the user signs the message and creates an agent.
3. an attacker see this and front runs the transaction with a different `tokenAddress` param 
4. the user intended to have the token address to be the address that was  initially given  by him. but because the `tokenAddress` param is not checked when recovering the message ,an attacker was able to manipulate that and is able to change it easily causing the users intended `tokenAddress` to change.



### Impact

this will cause the signature replay attacks or front running and as i mentioned in the above attack path this could lead to the user to have different token addresses when creating an agent.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. use openzeppelin's `Nonces` contract  and increment the nonce of the signer.
2. include the `tokenAddress` param in the messageHash and check if the `tokenAddress` is the same when using `createAgentWithTokenWithSig`.
