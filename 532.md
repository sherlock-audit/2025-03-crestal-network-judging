# `userTopUp` Function Allows Users to Deposit ERC20 Tokens Which Cannot be Used Later, Causing Potential User Funds Loss

### Summary

The `[userTopUp](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L751)` function is designed to allow users to deposit ERC20 tokens into the smart contract's designated wallet address. Its intended purpose appears to be enabling users to pre-fund their account balance, which can then be used for subsequent actions such as creating agents, upgrading projects, or paying related service fees.

However, the current implementation of subsequent functionalities (such as creating agents or upgrading projects) does not utilize or deduct from this prepaid balance. Instead, these operations require users to pay additional tokens directly, ignoring the funds previously deposited via the `userTopUp` function.


### Root Cause

The pre-fund is not used for any paying operation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

NA

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

1. The user calls `userTopUp` and deposits ERC20 tokens into the contract's wallet, expecting it to be used for future operations.
2. Later, when the user attempts to perform operations (e.g., `createAgentWithToken` or upgrades), the contract logic requires the user to pay again directly from their wallet, ignoring the previously deposited balance.
3. Consequently, the user's previously deposited tokens remain locked and unused, causing unintended loss and potential frustration.


### Impact

Users lose access to tokens deposited via `userTopUp` because those funds become unusable, leading to unintended loss of assets.

Tokens deposited through the `userTopUp` function become effectively locked and unusable, causing unintended financial loss and confusion for users who expect their deposited balance to offset future payments.



### PoC

NA

### Mitigation

Modify the payment logic of subsequent operations (such as creating agents, upgrading projects) to first utilize the user's existing prepaid balance before requiring direct payments from their wallet.
