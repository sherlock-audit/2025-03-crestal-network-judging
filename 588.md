# Project ID Collision Vulnerability in createProjectID() Function

### Summary

The [createProjectID()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L189) function generates project IDs using only block.timestamp, msg.sender, and block.chainid as inputs to keccak256. This implementation creates a vulnerability where multiple project creations by the same user in the same block would generate identical project IDs, causing subsequent transactions to fail due to duplicated IDs.



### Root Cause

The function lacks sufficient entropy to guarantee uniqueness when multiple projects are created by the same user within a single block. The current implementation relies on three values that remain unchanged within a block for a particular user:

- block.timestamp - Same for all transactions in a block
- msg.sender - Same for transactions from the same user
- block.chainid - Constant for all transactions

Without a nonce or counter mechanism, repeated calls within the same block will produce identical hashes.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The newProject modifier in setProjectId() prevents duplicate project IDs
- The contract stores projects in a mapping using the generated ID as key
- No counter/nonce mechanism exists to differentiate between calls from the same user

### External Pre-conditions

- A user attempts to create multiple projects within the same block
- High gas price periods could increase likelihood as transactions batch together
- Layer 2 solutions or high-throughput chains with quick block times increase likelihood

### Attack Path

1. User calls createProjectID() for the first time in a block
2. First transaction succeeds, project ID is recorded in projects mapping
3. User calls createProjectID() again in the same block
4. Second call generates identical project ID (same inputs to keccak256)
5. newProject modifier check fails: require(projects[projectId].id == 0, "projectId already exists")
6. Second transaction reverts, preventing multi-project creation


### Impact

- Functionality Limitation: Users cannot create multiple projects within the same block
- Wasted Gas: Failed transactions still consume gas, causing financial loss
- Poor UX: Users experience unexpected failures when creating projects rapidly
- Limited Throughput: Contract cannot handle burst operations efficiently
- Contract Inflexibility: As noted in the FIXME comment, this design flaw prevents operations that should be possible

### PoC

```solidity
// Test contract to demonstrate the vulnerability
contract ProjectIDCollisionTest {
    function testProjectIDCollision(address blueprintCoreAddress) external returns (bool) {
        BlueprintCore blueprint = BlueprintCore(blueprintCoreAddress);
        
        // First call succeeds
        bytes32 id1 = blueprint.createProjectID();
        
        // Second call will revert if in same block
        // This happens because id2 will be identical to id1
        bytes32 id2 = blueprint.createProjectID();
        
        return id1 == id2; // Will never reach here if in same block
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Implement a nonce-based approach to ensure uniqueness across all project ID generations:
```solidity
// Add a mapping to track nonces per user
mapping(address => uint256) private projectNonces;

function createProjectID() public returns (bytes32 projectId) {
    // Get and increment the nonce atomically
    uint256 nonce = projectNonces[msg.sender]++;
    
    // Include nonce in hash generation
    projectId = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, msg.sender, block.chainid, nonce));

    setProjectId(projectId, msg.sender);
}
```

This implementation ensures unique project IDs even with multiple transactions from the same user within a block, by tracking a per-user nonce that increments with each project creation.
