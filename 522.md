# We can't create a deployment request to an already existing project due to the `modifier newProject()`

### Summary

If a user wants first to create a project and then to create an associated deployment request id with it, he should be able to do so, but the `modifier newProject()` prevents him to do so.

### Root Cause

Overly validated function - `setProjectId()` should have different validation than the current one, so the user can actually create a associated deployment request id with a project created beforehand.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Alice decides to create a project via `createProjectId()`
2. Alice then wants to assign her newly created project an deployment request id via `createProjectIDAndPrivateDeploymentRequest()`, but finds out she can't due to the overly validated function

### Impact

Users with a project firstly created can't associate it to a deployment request id, thus broken functionality.
