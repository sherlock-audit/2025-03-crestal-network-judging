# Malicious Actors Will Deploy Untrusted Solvers In The Protocol

### Summary

The lack of validation between proposed and deployed solver addresses allows malicious users to override the intended solver during deployment. This architectural flaw enables unauthorized solvers to hijack project execution compromising project integrity and reputation

### Root Cause

When a project owner submits a proposal, the specified solver address is stored in a mapping called `requestSolver`.
```solidity
if (solverAddress != dummyAddress) {
    requestSolver[requestID] = solverAddress; // Proposal solver stored
}
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L205-L236

The contract correctly stores the solver address in `requestSolver[requestID]`.
However, this value is never referenced or enforced during the deployment phase.

During the deployment phase, the contract allows setting a solver address without verifying whether it matches the solver address proposed earlier
```solidity
projects[projectId].proposedSolverAddr = solverAddress; 

```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L283-L324

Expected Behavior:

The solver used in deployment `(solverAddress)` should be validated against the solver previously assigned in the proposal `(requestSolver[requestID])`.

Actual Behavior:

The deployment process does not check whether the solver matches the previously proposed solver.
Instead, it simply overwrites the proposedSolverAddr field in the projects mapping without any validation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Project owner creates valid proposal with `solverAddress = SolverA`
Same/different account calls deployment function with `solverAddress = SolverB`
The protocol does not enforce prior validation of proposal existence for deployments allowing `solverB` to be accepted.


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A legitimate user initiates a project proposal with a trusted solver
```solidity
requestSolver[proposalID] = SolverA;  // Stores the proposal solver
projects[projectId].requestProposalID = proposalID;  // Links proposal to project
```
At this point, the project is correctly associated with SolverA, which is the legitimate solver proposed by the project owner.

2. Same/different actor submits a deployment request specifying an unauthorized solver SolverB instead of the approved SolverA.
```solidity
   function deploymentRequest(
        address userAddress,
        bytes32 projectId,
        address solverAddress,
        address workerAddress,
        string memory base64Proposal,
        string memory serverURL,
        uint256 index
    )

projects[projectId].proposedSolverAddr = SolverB;  // Overwrites the legitimate solver
```
Violated Invariant: 
`Project.proposedSolverAddr` should always match `requestSolver[activeProposalID]` if a proposal exists

### Impact

Off-chain agreements (e.g., SLAs with approved solvers) become unenforceable.
Malicious solvers can  Hijack execution of projects

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The system must validate that the solver in the deployment phase matches the solver assigned during the proposal phase
