# Unauthorized `BlueprintCore::submitDeploymentRequest` Calls Lead to Workflow Disruption

**Description:** 

The [submitDeploymentRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L620) function emits `AcceptDeployment` event which denotes that a worker has started working on deployment process. It is an essential part of the Crestalâ€™s worker deployment process that emits important event containing information about requestId and the selected Worker address denoting the worker working on the deployment. However, it has a critical flaw; any arbitrary caller can call this function which sets the following,

```bash
    requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status = Status.Pickup;
    requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].deployWorkerAddr = msg.sender;

```
Once the status is set to Pickup, the actual worker or Crestal team cannot call it,

```javascript
    require(
        requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status != Status.Pickup,
        "requestID already picked by another worker, try a different requestID"
    );
```

In addition, `BlueprintCore::submitProofOfDeployment` can only be called by `deployWorkerAddr` so if an arbitrary caller calls `submitDeploymentRequest`, it results in DoS in `submitProofOfDeployment` when a legit worker calls it, 

```javascript
require(requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].deployWorkerAddr == msg.sender, "Wrong worker address");

```

This distrupts the entire workflow of the Crestal deployment process since this detaches Blueprint from the worker.


**Impact:** 

Attackers can systematically block requests, halting protocol operations.

**Recommended Mitigation:** 

Consider restricting `submitDeploymentRequest` to authorized workers (e.g., via a whitelist or role-based checks):
