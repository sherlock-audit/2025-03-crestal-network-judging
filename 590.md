# Project status won't can't be set to deployed

### Summary

Project status won't can't be set to deployed

### Root Cause
The docs stipulate that once a project is deployed, the Status should be set to `Deployed`, however this is not the case in the current system
After deployment, the status of the project should be set to deployed.

```solidity
    enum Status {
        Init,
        Issued,
        Pickup,
        Deploying,
        Deployed,
        GeneratedProof
    }
```

However no function will do this.
