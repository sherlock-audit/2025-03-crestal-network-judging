# missing function to add allowed payment tokens

### Summary

The system is missing function that allows addition of payment tokens

### Root Cause

The system is missing a function to add a payment token to the [paymentAddressEnableMp](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L95-L96) mapping, which means that the current system is not able to receive any kind of payment.


```solidity
    mapping(address => bool) public paymentAddressEnableMp;
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

none needed

### External Pre-conditions

none needed

### Attack Path

none needed

### Impact

Currently some actions are only possible through payment of tokens, if no token is valid, these functions will revert each time:

`createAgent` through token will fail
`updateWorkerDeploymentConfigCommon` will fail 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add a function to validate payment options
