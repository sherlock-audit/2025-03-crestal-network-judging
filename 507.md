# Unauthorized Workers Can Claim Deployment Tasks Due to Missing Validation

### Summary

The `submitDeploymentRequest` function in [BlueprintCore.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L602) lacks validation to verify that the caller (`msg.sender`) is a registered worker. This allows any address to claim deployment tasks, becoming designated as the worker for that request without being properly registered in the system. This breaks the intended access control model and can lead to unauthorized parties executing sensitive deployment operations.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability exists because the `submitDeploymentRequest` function doesn't check if the caller's address has registered as a worker before allowing them to claim a deployment request. While workers are expected to register by calling `setWorkerPublicKey()` which sets their public key in the `workersPublicKey` mapping, the `submitDeploymentRequest` function fails to verify this registration.

Unlike other functions such as `submitProofOfDeployment` which at least verify that the caller is the assigned worker for a specific request (but still not if they are registered), this function allows any address to become designated as a worker without any validation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A deployment request must exist (verified by `require(requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status != Status.Init)`)
2. The request must not be picked up by another worker (verified by `require(requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status != Status.Pickup)`)
3. The request must not already have submitted proof (verified by `require(requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status != Status.GeneratedProof)`)

### External Pre-conditions

1. Knowledge of a valid `projectId` and `requestID`
2. The ability to call the contract directly (no signature validation or access control)

### Attack Path

1. The attacker waits for a legitimate user to create a deployment request, obtaining a valid `projectId` and `requestID` by monitoring on-chain events
2. The attacker calls `submitDeploymentRequest` with the valid parameters before legitimate workers can respond
3. The function updates `requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status` to `Status.Pickup`
4. The attacker's address is stored as `requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].deployWorkerAddr`
5. The function returns `true` and emits an `AcceptDeployment` event
6. The attacker is now the designated worker for that deployment request without being registered in the system

### Impact

1. **Unauthorized Access:** Malicious actors can claim deployment tasks without proper registration
2. **Denial of Service:** Legitimate workers are prevented from claiming tasks that are already picked up
3. **System Subversion:** The worker reputation and accountability system is undermined
4. **Trust Degradation:** Users cannot trust that their deployments are handled by properly registered and vetted workers
5. **Possible Disclosure of Sensitive Data:** The attacker might gain access to deployment details they shouldn't have access to

### PoC

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

import "./BlueprintCore.sol";

contract AttackWorkerValidation {
    BlueprintCore private blueprintCore;
    
    constructor(address _blueprintCoreAddress) {
        blueprintCore = BlueprintCore(_blueprintCoreAddress);
    }
    
    // Attack function that can be called by any address without worker registration
    function claimDeploymentRequest(bytes32 projectId, bytes32 requestID) external returns (bool) {
        // Directly call submitDeploymentRequest without being a registered worker
        return blueprintCore.submitDeploymentRequest(projectId, requestID);
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Add a worker validation check to the `submitDeploymentRequest` function:
```solidity
function submitDeploymentRequest(bytes32 projectId, bytes32 requestID)
    public
    hasProject(projectId)
    returns (bool isAccepted)
{
    require(requestID.length > 0, "requestID is empty");
    require(requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status != Status.Init, "requestID does not exist");
    require(
        requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status != Status.Pickup,
        "requestID already picked by another worker, try a different requestID"
    );
    require(
        requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status != Status.GeneratedProof, "requestID has already submitted proof"
    );
    
    // Add validation to ensure caller is a registered worker
    require(workersPublicKey[msg.sender].length > 0, "Caller is not a registered worker");

    // currently, do first come, first server, will do a better way in the future
    requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].status = Status.Pickup;
    requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].deployWorkerAddr = msg.sender;

    // set project deployed worker address
    isAccepted = true;

    emit AcceptDeployment(projectId, requestID, requestDeploymentStatus[requestID].deployWorkerAddr);
}
```

Additionally, consider implementing a more comprehensive worker verification system:

1. Implement a proper role-based access control system
2. Require workers to stake tokens or provide collateral before accepting tasks
3. Add reputation-based assignment rather than first-come-first-served
4. Implement a vetting process before allowing workers to register
5. Include expiration times for worker registrations that require periodic renewal
