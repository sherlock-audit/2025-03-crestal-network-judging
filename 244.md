# Anyone can call submitDeploymentRequest(), which leads to serious consequences

### Summary

The function `submitDeploymentRequest()` has no access control even though it's a critical function, ( it's meant for workers and not normal users, its role is to pickup a deployment request by a worker ) , which leads to devastating consequences ( DoS'ing any deployments from happening ).

### Root Cause

[`BlueprintCore.sol:602-L626`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L602-L626) , notice that it's a public function which performs a critical action ( picking up a deployment request ) . 

According to the flow explained in the [docs](https://docs.crestal.network/solvers/worker#deployment-workflow), the flow is supposed to work like this: 
1. Builder triggers the Blueprint smart contract by requesting a proposal deployment.
2. The Blueprint Smart Contract processes deployment requests and emits one of two events depending on the proposal type, ( in this case it's `RequestDeployment` ).
3. Worker listens for `RequestDeployment` event and submits deployment request to the contract ( using the function `submitDeploymentRequest()`.
4. Blueprint Contract selects worker :
          - Receives multiple Worker requests.
          - Selects a Worker to handle the deployment using a first-come, first-serve strategy.
          - Emits an `AcceptDeployment` event containing the requestId and the selected Worker address.
          
5. Selected Worker: Listens for `AcceptDeployment` events to verify if they are assigned.  And if selected : Performs the real deployment.


But the workers are not whitelisted , and anyone can listen for the event `RequestDeployment` , and once it's emitted he calls `submitDeploymentRequest()` which changes the status to `Status.Pickup` and `isAccpted` to `true`, preventing legit workers from deploying, and causing a DoS.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Attacker needs to be the first to call `submitDeploymentRequest()`, which can be done easily using a bot.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. A user triggers the Blueprint smart contract by requesting a proposal deployment.
2. The Blueprint Smart Contract emit the `RequestDeployment` event.
3. An attacker is listening to this event ( using a bot for example ) , once it's emitted , he calls `submitDeploymentRequest()` before any workers, which leads to DoSing deployment, since any legit worker which calls it after him will revert.
4. **Optional** : Attacker submits a fake proof of deployment.

### Impact

This could lead to serious consequences since an attacker may automate it using a bot, once any `RequestDeployment` event is received he calls `submitDeploymentRequest()` using that  request Id, DoS'ing any deployment from happening ! and sabotaging this critical functionality forever.

- Here's an example of how a bot may look like ( just for demonstration purposes, it's not runnable right now since the contract is not yet deployed ) :
```js
const { ethers } = require('ethers');

// Setup provider (Infura WebSocket for real-time)
const provider = new ethers.WebSocketProvider('wss://mainnet.infura.io/ws/v3/YOUR-API-KEY');

const wallet = new ethers.Wallet('0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY', provider);

// Contract details (replace with real address and ABI)
const contractAddress = '0xBLUEPRINT_ADDRESS';
const abi = [ /* Paste BlueprintCore ABI here, or load from a JSON file */ ];
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, wallet);

async function listenAndSubmit() {
  console.log('Bot started. Listening for RequestDeployment events...');

  // Listen for RequestDeployment events
  contract.on('RequestDeployment', async (projectID, walletAddress, solverAddress, requestID, base64Proposal, serverURL, event) => {
    try {
      console.log(`Event detected: projectID=${projectID}, requestID=${requestID}`);

      // Check if itâ€™s public (workerAddress would be 0x0 for public in private events)
      const status = await contract.requestDeploymentStatus(requestID);
      if (status.status !== 1) { // Status.Issued = 1, not picked up yet
        console.log(`Request ${requestID} already picked up or invalid. Skipping.`);
        return;
      }

      // Submit the deployment request
      console.log(`Submitting deployment request for ${requestID}...`);
      const tx = await contract.submitDeploymentRequest(projectID, requestID, {
        gasLimit: 200000, // Adjust based on profiling
        gasPrice: ethers.parseUnits('20', 'gwei'), // 20 gwei, tweak as needed
      });

      // Wait for confirmation
      const receipt = await tx.wait();
      console.log(`Success! Tx hash: ${receipt.transactionHash}`);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`something went wrong: ${error.message}`);
    }
  });

  // Handle WebSocket disconnects
  provider.websocket.on('close', () => {
    console.log('WebSocket closed. Reconnecting...');
    listenAndSubmit(); // Restart listener
  });
}

// Kick it off
listenAndSubmit();
```

### Mitigation

Add a mapping with whitelisted worker addresses, then make sure the `submitDeploymentRequest()` msg.sender is a worker.
