# Anyone can call `payWithERC20` to steal the tokens

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/Payment.sol#L25-L33
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L479-L489

Anyone can call `payWithERC20` in order to steal approved tokens from the contract because there is not any check or modifier to guard the function.

```solidity
function payWithERC20(address erc20TokenAddress, uint256 amount, address fromAddress, address toAddress) public {
    // check from and to address
    require(fromAddress != toAddress, "Cannot transfer to self address");
    require(toAddress != address(0), "Invalid to address");
    require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
    IERC20 token = IERC20(erc20TokenAddress);
    token.safeTransferFrom(fromAddress, toAddress, amount);
}
```

### Root Cause

Wrong function visibility or missing check/guard in `payWithERC20` will lead to stealing all tokens for the given ERC20 token address from the contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A random user should approve the Blueprint contract with X amount of tokens

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

1. A random user approves the Blueprint contract with `cost` amount of X tokens
2. The same user calls `createAgentWithToken` function. The `createAgent` internal function calls `payWithERC20` for the provided `tokenAddress` in order to transfer the `cost` amount of tokens to `feeCollectionWalletAddress`
3. A malicious user sees the transaction, frontruns it and calls the `payWithERC20`
4. The malicious user gets the tokens and the function in Step 2 reverts

### Impact

Arbitrary amount of any ERC20 token can be stolen from any user.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change the visibility of `payWithERC20` function to `internal` or add a onlyBlueprintContract modifier.
