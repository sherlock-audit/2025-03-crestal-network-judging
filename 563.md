# Anyone can reset project information, impacting user operations.

### Summary

The lack of access control in the `upgradeProject` function will cause a disruption in user operations for project owners as an attacker will reset project information without authorization.

### Root Cause

In `src/BlueprintCore.sol`, the `upgradeProject` function is publicly accessible without any ownership or permission checks.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Any user can call the `upgradeProject` function with a valid `projectId`.
2. The `projectId` must exist in the `projects` mapping.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The project must have been created previously and exist in the contract.


### Attack Path

1. An attacker calls the `upgradeProject` function with a valid `projectId` of a project they do not own.
2. The function executes, resetting critical project information such as `requestProposalID`, `requestDeploymentID`, and `proposedSolverAddr` to default values.
3. The attacker can repeat this process for multiple projects, causing confusion and disruption for legitimate users.

### Impact

The project owners suffer a loss of functionality as their project information is reset, which can disrupt ongoing operations and lead to confusion among users. The attacker does not gain control but can cause significant disruption by repeatedly resetting project states.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement access control mechanisms to ensure that only the project owner or authorized users can call the upgradeProject function. This can be achieved by using modifiers to check the caller's address against a mapping of project owners.
