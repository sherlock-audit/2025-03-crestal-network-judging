# Signature Replay Vulnerability in createAgentWithTokenWithSig Function Enabling Fund Drain Exploitation

### Summary

The createAgentWithTokenWithSig function is vulnerable to a signature replay attack. Malicious actors can reuse previously valid signatures to repeatedly call the function, creating multiple agents and potentially draining user funds or other system resources.

### Root Cause

The absence of nonce or state-tracking mechanisms in the function allows replay attacks. Valid signatures, once generated, can be reused without restriction, as the function does not verify if the signature was previously processed.

### Internal Pre-conditions

-The function lacks a nonce or unique identifier for each signature, enabling reuse of the same signature multiple times.

-The absence of a signature state-tracking system (e.g., used-signature registry) allows unrestricted function calls with the same signature.

### External Pre-conditions

A malicious user with access to a valid signature can repeatedly call the function to exploit the system and the public nature of transactions on the blockchain increases exposure to potential attackers who can capture and reuse signatures.

### Attack Path

-Attacker identifies an already used signature with valid project ID and calls createAgentWithTokenWithSig()
- This creates a new project agent or the user.
- payWithERC20()  is called to create agents which leads to user funds being drained



### Impact

Repeated calls to the function by reusing the same signature will result in draining of user funds as the function createAgentWithTokenWithSig () ultimately calls the   payWithERC20() which drains user tokens

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement Nonce Mechanism: Introduce a nonce for each signature, ensuring that every signature is valid for only one function call.
