# User will forever lock it's funds on top-up

### Summary

Whenever a user top-up his balance it can not be recovered, or used as intended.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L751-L762 when a user makes a top-up his balance is updated in the userTopUpMp but they are forever stuck in the contract. The topped-up balance is not used to create agent or update worker deployment config, as theu make new deposits on every call.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User calls top-up

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User calls top-up
2. User can no longer use the balance top-uped (he neither can use them to create agent neither to withdraw them)

### Impact

Every topped-up balance remains locked pretty much forever.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

[v](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L628) and https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L427 can be updated to use the user topped up balance.

Additionally, a withdraw method can be added.
