# Security Vulnerability in upgradeProject Function Leading to Unauthorized Access and Operational Disruption

**Summary**  
The absence of access control in the `upgradeProject` function can cause significant disruption for project owners. Malicious actors could exploit this vulnerability to reset critical project state data.

**Root Cause**  
The `upgradeProject` function resets the proposal and deployment IDs without verifying the callerâ€™s authorization. The `hasProject` modifier only ensures the project exists, but it does not check whether the caller is the project owner.

**Internal Pre-conditions**  
- **Project Existence**: The project identified by the given `projectId` must exist, enforced by the `hasProject` modifier.  
- **Lack of Ownership Verification**: There is no verification mechanism to ensure only the project owner can call `upgradeProject`.

**External Pre-conditions**  
- **User Access**: Any user with network access can invoke the `upgradeProject` function with a valid `projectId`.  
- **Blockchain Environment**: The vulnerability is inherent in the contract logic and is not influenced by external protocols.

**Attack Path**  
1. An attacker identifies or discovers a valid `projectId` belonging to another user.  
2. The attacker calls `upgradeProject(projectId)` using their own address.  
3. The function resets critical project configurations (e.g., `requestProposalID`, `requestDeploymentID`, and `proposedSolverAddr`), invalidating the legitimate project setup.  
4. The legitimate project owner loses control over their project, which can lead to operational disruption or denial of service.

**Impact**  
Project owners experience total operational disruption. Critical workflow data is erased, requiring a complete restart of the proposal and deployment processes. Attackers could systematically sabotage all projects within the protocol.

**Mitigation**  
**Implement Access Control**: Modify the `upgradeProject` function to ensure that only the project owner (or an authorized account) can call the function.
