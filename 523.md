# Unauthorized Worker Registration In `setWorkerPublicKey` Due To Missing Access Controls

### Summary

Any address can register itself as a worker by calling `setWorkerPublicKey()`, potentially undermining the worker registry integrity. This registration adds the caller to the worker list and stores their public key without any verification.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/27a3c28155702b3a68f29347efedffb048010e33/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L689C1-L695C6

```solidity
    function setWorkerPublicKey(bytes calldata publicKey) public {
        // @audit - missing check if verified worker in system
        if (workersPublicKey[msg.sender].length == 0) {
            workerAddressesMp[WORKER_ADDRESS_KEY].push(msg.sender);
        }

        workersPublicKey[msg.sender] = publicKey;
    }
```

The `setWorkerPublicKey()` function lacks proper access controls to restrict workers only to be able to set their public key.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The `setWorkerPublicKey()` function is public and has no authorization checks

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. An attacker calls setWorkerPublicKey() with any public key data
2. The attacker is now listed in the worker registry

### Impact

1. The attacker appears in results when users call `getWorkerAddresses()`

 2. The attacker's provided public key is accessible via getWorkerPublicKey()


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure a valid worker is calling `setWorkerPublicKey`
