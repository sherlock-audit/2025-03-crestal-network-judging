# Missing sender validation allows front running transactions by malicious user

### Summary

There is a missing check in all EIP712 functions in BlueprintCore.sol that the sender of the transaction matches the signer address

### Root Cause

All six functions in `BlueprintCore.sol` which use EIP712 are missing a check that msg.sender matches the address of the signer; see functions:
• [createProjectIDAndProposalRequestWithSig()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L265-L281)
• [createProjectIDAndDeploymentRequestWithSig()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L400-L414)
• [createAgentWithTokenWithSig()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L491-L508)
• [createAgentWithWhitelistUsersWithSig()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L540-L564)
• [createAgentWithSigWithNFT()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L566C14-L582)
• [updateWorkerDeploymentConfigWithSig()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-crestal-network/blob/main/crestal-omni-contracts/src/BlueprintCore.sol#L672C14-L686)

Without proper validation, a malicious actor can front-run a victim’s transaction by extracting its signature and data, then submitting a modified transaction before the victim. Because the same `structHash` is used across six different functions, the attacker can reuse the victim’s signed parameters in any of those six functions, not just the original one.
This enables the following attacks:
       • Transaction Hijacking – The attacker can call the same function with altered parameters before the victim’s transaction executes.
       • Cross-Function Exploitation – Since the `structHash` is identical, the extracted parameters can be repurposed for any of the six functions, allowing the attacker to execute an unintended function with the victim’s signature.
       • Replay Attack – If an attacker obtains a valid signature they can replay it indefinitely

Additionally, malicious user can also cause victims to lose money as in `payWithERC20()` is called from the victims account in the following functions:

```solidity
    function createAgent(
        address userAddress,
        bytes32 projectId,
        string memory base64Proposal,
        address privateWorkerAddress,
        string memory serverURL,
        uint256 tokenId,
        address tokenAddress
    ) internal returns (bytes32 requestID) {
---SNIP---
        } else {
---SNIP---
            uint256 cost = paymentOpCostMp[tokenAddress][CREATE_AGENT_OP];
            if (cost > 0) {
                // payment to crestal wallet address with token
                payWithERC20(tokenAddress, cost, userAddress, feeCollectionWalletAddress);
            }

---SNIP---
        }
    }

    function updateWorkerDeploymentConfigCommon(
        address tokenAddress,
        address userAddress,
        bytes32 projectId,
        bytes32 requestID,
        string memory updatedBase64Config
    ) internal hasProject(projectId) {
---SNIP---
        // get update agent cost
        uint256 cost = paymentOpCostMp[tokenAddress][UPDATE_AGENT_OP];

        if (cost > 0) {
            // transfer token to crestal wallet
            payWithERC20(tokenAddress, cost, userAddress, feeCollectionWalletAddress);
        }

---SNIP---
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Bob signs a transaction for one of the six vulnerable functions, which includes:
	• projectId
	• base64RecParam
	• signature
2. The contract does not check that msg.sender == signerAddr, allowing others to use Bob’s signature.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Bob submits a transaction to the mempool, but it is not yet mined

### Attack Path

1. Bob submits a transaction to `createProjectIDAndProposalRequestWithSig()` to the mempool, but it is not yet mined
2. A malicious actor sees Bob’s pending transaction and extracts:
	• projectId
	• base64RecParam
	• serverURL
	• signature
3. Attacker Submits a Different Transaction First using Bob's extracted variables and configuring the additional ones as they like to `createAgentWithTokenWithSig()`
4. attacker provides higher gas fees so their transaction is mined first, making it appear that the project already has an active deployment request.
5. An agent is created with attackers variables and Bob has to pay the cost for something they didnt want in payWithERC20
5. Bob’s Original Transaction Fails

### Impact

Transactions can be replayed by malicious user.
All transactions requiring signature can be front-run.
Victim loses funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

A simple check added to all six vulnerable functions prevents the issue:

```diff
+      require(msg.sender == signerAddr, "Unauthorized sender");
```
